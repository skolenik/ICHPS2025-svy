  title     = {Modeling Repeated Count Data Subject to Informative
          Dropout},
  abstract  = {In certain diseases, outcome is the number of morbid
          events over the course of follow-up. In epilepsy, e.g.,
          daily seizure counts are often used to reflect disease
          severity. Follow-up of patients in clinical trials of such
          diseases is often subject to censoring due to patients
          dying or dropping out. If the sicker patients tend to be
          censored in such trials, estimates of the treatment effect
          that do not incorporate the censoring process may be
          misleading. We extend the shared random effects approach of
          Wu and Carroll (1988, Biometrics44, 1752013188) to the
          setting of repeated counts of events. Three strategies are
          developed. The first is a likelihood-based approach for
          jointly modeling the count and censoring processes. A
          shared random effect is incorporated to introduce
          dependence between the two processes. The second is a
          likelihood-based approach that conditions on the dropout
          times in adjusting for informative dropout. The third is a
          generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach, which also
          conditions on the dropout times but makes fewer assumptions
          about the distribution of the count process. Estimation
          procedures for each of the approaches are discussed, and
          the approaches are applied to data from an epilepsy
          clinical trial. A simulation study is also conducted to
          compare the various approaches. Through analyses and
          simulations, we demonstrate the flexibility of the
          likelihood-based conditional model for analyzing data from
          the epilepsy trial.},

          identified by restrictions on the elements of the factor
          loading matrix; the number of restrictions may exceed that
          required for identification. It is shown that a particular
          centering of the maximum likelihood estimator derived under
          assumed normality of observations yields an asymptotic
          normal distribution that is common to a wide class of
          distributions of the factor vectors and error vectors. In
          particular, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the factor
          loading estimator derived under the normal assumption is
          shown to be valid for the factor vectors containing a fixed
          part and a random part with any distribution having finite
          second moments and for the error vectors consisting of
          independent components with any distributions having finite
          second moments. Thus the asymptotic standard errors of the
          factor loading estimators computed by standard computer
          packages are valid for virtually any type of nonnormal
          factor analysis. The results are extended to certain
          structural equation models.}

          endogenous variable in an instrumental variables regression
          model. The focus is on determining tests that have some
          optimal power properties. We start by considering a model
          with normally distributed errors and known error covariance
          matrix. We consider tests that are similar and satisfy a
          natural rotational invariance condition. We determine a
          two-sided power envelope for invariant similar tests. This
          allows us to assess and compare the power properties of
          tests such as the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR), the
          Lagrange multiplier, and the Anderson-Rubin tests. We find
          that the CLR test is quite close to being uniformly most
          powerful invariant among a class of two-sided tests. The
          finite-sample results of the paper are extended to the case
          of unknown error covariance matrix and possibly nonnormal
          errors via weak instrument asymptotics. Strong instrument
          asymptotic results also are provided because we seek tests

          example, the results apply to tests of one-time structural
          change with unknown change-point. Several other examples
          are discussed in the paper. The results of the paper are of
          interest, because the testing problem considered is
          nonstandard and the classical asymptotic optimality results
          for the Lagrange multiplier (LM), Wald, and likelihood
          ratio (LR) tests do not apply. A weighted average power
          criterion is used here to generate optimal tests. This
          criterion is similar to that used by Wald (1943) to obtain
          the classical asymptotic optimality properties of Wald
          tests in "regular" testing problems. In fact, the optimal
          tests introduced here reduce to the standard LM, Wald, and
          LR tests when standard regularity conditions hold.
          Nevertheless, in the nonstandard cases of main interest,
          new optimal tests are obtained and the LR test is not found
          to be an optimal test.}

        Hot deck imputation is a method for handling missing data in which
        each missing value is replaced with an observed response from a
        "similar" unit. Despite being used extensively in practice, the
        theory is not as well developed as that of other imputation methods.
        We have found that no consensus exists as to the best way to apply
        the hot deck and obtain inferences from the completed data set. Here
        we review different forms of the hot deck and existing research on
        its statistical properties. We describe applications of the hot deck
        currently in use, including the {U.S}. Census Bureau's hot deck for
        the Current Population Survey ({CPS}). We also provide an extended
        example of variations of the hot deck applied to the third National
        Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES} {III}). Some
        potential areas for future research are highlighted.

          region-to-region migration flows in 1992-99, we estimate
          the effect of economic, political and social factors.
          Although overall migration is rather low, it turns out that
          its intensity does depend on economic factors even
          controlling for fixed effects for each origin-destination
          pair. People move from poorer and job scarce regions with
          worse public good provision to those which are richer and
          prospering better both in terms of employment prospects and
          public goods. Migration is, however, constrained by the
          lack of liquidity; for the poorest regions, an increase in
          income raises rather than decreases outmigration. Our
          estimates imply that up to a third of Russian regions are
          locked in poverty traps.},

          starting age created by children's dates of birth provides
          a natural experiment for estimating the effect of age at
          school entry. Because no large data set contains
          information on both age at school entry and educational
          attainment, we use an instrumental variables (IV) estimator
          with data derived from the 1960 and 1980 Censuses to
          estimate and test the age-at-entry/compulsory schooling
          model. In most IV applications, the two covariance matrices
          that form the estimator are constructed from the same
          sample. We use a method-of-moments framework to discuss IV
          estimators that combine moments from different data sets.
          In our application, quarter of birth dummies are the
          instrumental variables used to link the 1960 Census, from
          which age at school entry can be derived for one cohort of
          students, to the 1980 Census, which contains educational
          attainment for the same cohort of students. The results
          suggest that compulsory attendance laws constrain roughly
          10% of students to stay in school.}

      { Researchers are increasingly using complex population-based sample surveys
      to estimate the effects of treatments, exposures and interventions. In such
      analyses, statistical methods are essential to minimize the effect of
      confounding due to measured covariates, as treated subjects frequently differ
      from control subjects. Methods based on the propensity score are increasingly
      popular. Minimal research has been conducted on how to implement propensity
      score matching when using data from complex sample surveys. We used Monte
      Carlo simulations to examine two critical issues when implementing propensity
      score matching with such data. First, we examined how the propensity score
      model should be formulated. We considered three different formulations
      depending on whether or not a weighted regression model was used to estimate
      the propensity score and whether or not the survey weights were included in
      the propensity score model as an additional covariate. Second, we examined
      whether matched control subjects should retain their natural survey weight or
      whether they should inherit the survey weight of the treated subject to which
      they were matched. Our results were inconclusive with respect to which method
      of estimating the propensity score model was preferable. In general, greater
      balance in measured baseline covariates and decreased bias was observed when
      natural retained weights were used compared to when inherited weights were
      used. We also demonstrated that bootstrap-based methods performed well for
      estimating the variance of treatment effects when outcomes are binary. We
      illustrated the application of our methods by using the Canadian Community
      Health Survey to estimate the effect of educational attainment on lifetime
      prevalence of mood or anxiety disorders. }

          based on them. The residuals apply to any point process
          model that has a conditional intensity; the model may
          exhibit spatial heterogeneity, interpoint interaction and
          dependence on spatial covariates. Some existing ad hoc
          methods for model checking (quadrat counts, scan statistic,
          kernel smoothed intensity and Berman's diagnostic) are
          recovered as special cases. Diagnostic tools are developed

          residuals and the usual residuals for (non-spatial)
          generalized linear models. The conditional intensity ?
          plays the role of the mean response. This makes it possible
          to adapt existing knowledge about model validation for
          generalized linear models to the spatial point process
          context, giving recommendations for diagnostic plots. A
          plot of smoothed residuals against spatial location, or
          against a spatial covariate, is effective in diagnosing
          spatial trend or co-variate effects. Q–Q-plots of the

  title     = {Empirical likelihood as a goodness-of-fit measure},
  abstract  = {The method of empirical likelihood can be viewed as one of
          allocating probabilities to an n-cell contingency table so
          as to minimise a goodness-of-fit criterion. It is shown
          that, when the Cressie-Read power-divergence statistic is
          used as the criterion, confidence regions enjoying the same
          convergence rates as those found for empirical likelihood
          can be obtained for the entire range of values of the
          Cressie-Read parameter {lambda}, including -1, maximum
          entropy, 0, empirical likelihood, and 1, Pearson's {chi}2.
          It is noted that, in the power-divergence family, empirical
          likelihood is the only member which is Bartlett-correctable.
          However, simulation results suggest that, for the mean,
          using a, scaled F distribution yields more accurate
          coverage levels for moderate sample sizes.
          10.1093/biomet/85.3.535},
  comment   = {Empirical likelihood is applied to the contingency tables
          analysis; no other chi-square goodness-of-fit measures are
          discussed, although the generalizations might be available.
          Relation to Cressie-Read is made, but most econometric
          papers have better discussions of it. No econometrics
          papers are mentioned whatsoever.

          Interesting qualitative shifts are observed for specific
          values of Cressie-Read parameter. First, at \$\labmda=0\$
          (empirical likelihood), the behavior changes with respect
          to the true value being in the convex hull or not: for
          \$\lambda \ge 0\$, the CI is always within the convex hull.
          Second, at \$\lambda=-1\$ (maximum entropy, exponential
          tilting), there is some argument about optimal allocation
          that I did not get. Third, at \$\lambda=-2\$
          (Neyman-modified \$\chi^2\$, Euclidean likelihood, or
          Hotelling \$T^2\$ for the normal mean), the shape of the
          confidence region changes: for \$\lambda>-2\$, they
          protrude towards outliers, and for \$\lambda<-2\$, tilted
          away from them, which is hardly reasonable.

          The analytical expression for the second order
          \$O(n^{-1})\$ term in the ELRT statistic is derived for the
          case of \$N(0,I)\$ mean.

          The simulations compared performance of the \$\chi^2\$,
          Bartlett-corrected \$\chi^2\$, and scaled \$F\$
          distributions for a range of \$\lambda\$ values, sample
          sizes, and distributions. It appears that Bartlett
          correction is performing well in the center of the
          distribution (i.e., for the confidence regions of about
          50\% coverage), but \$F\$ distributions appear better at
          the tails. Normal and \$t\_5\$ distributions worked best
          for \$\lambda\$ between -2 and 0 (Euclidean to empirical
          likelihood), while \$\chi^2\$ distribution worked better
          with \$\labmda\$ around 2 (Pearson's \$\chi^2\$).

          Finally, of all Cressie-Read test statistics, only the
          empirical likelihood was found to be Bartlett-correctable.

          Overall, a paper with many important technical results, but not terribly well written.},

          by RMT},
  abstract  = {In this paper, we give an explanation to the failure of
          two likelihood ratio procedures for testing about
          covariance matrices from Gaussian populations when the
          dimension is large compared to the sample size. Next, using
          recent central limit theorems for linear spectral
          statistics of sample covariance matrices and of random
          F-matrices, we propose necessary corrections for these LR
          tests to cope with high-dimensional effects. The asymptotic
          distributions of these corrected tests under the null are
          given. Simulations demonstrate that the corrected LR tests
          yield a realized size close to nominal level for both
          moderate p (around 20) and high dimension, while the
          traditional LR tests with chi-square approximation fails.
          Another contribution from the paper is that for testing the
          equality between two covariance matrices, the proposed
          correction applies equally for non-Gaussian populations
          yielding a valid pseudo-likelihood ratio test.},

  title     = {Estimating Multilevel Linear Models as Structural Equation
          Models},
  abstract  = {Multilevel linear models (MLMs) provide a powerful
          framework for analyzing data collected at nested or
          non-nested levels, such as students within classrooms. The
          current article draws on recent analytical and software
          advances to demonstrate that a broad class of MLMs may be
          estimated as structural equation models (SEMs). Moreover,
          within the SEM approach it is possible to include
          measurement models for predictors or outcomes, and to
          estimate the mediational pathways among predictors
          explicitly, tasks which are currently difficult with the
          conventional approach to multilevel modeling. The
          equivalency of the SEM approach with conventional methods
          for estimating MLMs is illustrated using empirical
          examples, including an example involving both multiple
          indicator latent factors for the outcomes and a causal
          chain for the predictors. The limitations of this approach
          for estimating MLMs are discussed and alternative
          approaches are considered. 10.3102/10769986028002135},

          of data apply, but data are often collected from complex
          surveys involving clustering, stratification and unequal
          probabilities of selection. As a result, application of

          the design effects are obtained. The case of one- and
          two-way analyses of variance of domain means is first
          studied and then extended to include generalized linear
          models. The special case of a Poisson model is studied in

          Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing},
  abstract  = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for
          controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This
          approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A
          different approach to problems of multiple significance
          testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected
          proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false
          discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER
          when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise.
          Therefore, in problems where the control of the false
          discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
          there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential
          Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false
          discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a
          simulation study shows that the gain in power is
          substantial. The use of the new procedure and the
          appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with
          examples.},

  abstract  = {Normed and nonnormed fit indexes are frequently used as
          adjuncts to chi-square statistics for evaluating the fit of
          a structural model. A drawback of existing indexes is that
          they estimate no known population parameters. A new
          coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction
          in the noncentrality parameters of two nested models. Two
          estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFI) and
          nonnormed (FI) fit indexes. CFI avoids the underestimation
          of fit often noted in small samples for Bentler and
          Bonett's (1980) normed fit index (NFI). FI is a linear
          function of Bentler and Bonett's non-normed fit index
          (NNFI) that avoids the extreme underestimation and
          overestimation often found in NNFI. Asymptotically, CFI,
          FI, NFI, and a new index developed by Bollen are equivalent
          measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFI measures relative
          fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All
          of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and
          Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the
          behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct
          specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes

          inappropriate as a single summary of the internal
          consistency of a composite score. Better estimators of
          internal consistency are available. In addition to those
          mentioned by Sijtsma, an old dimension-free coefficient and
          structural equation model based coefficients are proposed
          to improve the routine reporting of psychometric internal
          consistency. The various ways to measure internal
          consistency are also shown to be appropriate to binary and
          polytomous items.},
  comment   = {Bentler (2009) discusses several alternative measures of
          internal consistency of a composite score: "greatest lower
          bound", Benter's lower bound, Kronbach's alpha, 1-factor
          reliability. He shows relations between them under various
          assumptions: (i) whether the factor model does or does not
          hold; (ii) whether or not Heywood cases are allowed; (iii)
          whether or not the error are allowed to covary; (iv)
          whether the degrees of freedom of the model are positive
          (confirmatory analysis) or negative (exploratory analysis).

          He also briefly discusses the issue of sampling variation
          as a source of bias for some of the measures, although
          that's about two paragraphs.

          Bentler kind of expects the reader to see right through the
          argument to the key point. I am personally not able to do
          it so quickly, even though I do know Kronbach's alpha
          sucks. The paper does not provide a clear cut set of
          scenarios under which each of the discussed internal
          consistency measures is meaningful -- for each of the
          measures, the ideas are thrown out as to when it
          outperforms alpha, and sometimes how it compares with
          another randomly chosen measure. If you want to see a big
          picture, all that information needs to be hand-picked and
          presented as a table or something, so expect going over
          this paper with an extra sheet of paper and a pencil.},

          studying relationships among multivariate data. In
          practice, high dimensional nonnormal data with small to
          medium sample sizes are very common, and large sample
          theory, on which almost all modeling statistics are based,
          cannot be invoked for model evaluation with test
          statistics. The most natural method for nonnormal data, the
          asymptotically distribution free procedure, is not defined
          when the sample size is less than the number of
          nonduplicated elements in the sample covariance. Since
          normal theory maximum likelihood estimation remains defined
          for intermediate to small sample size, it may be invoked

          in model evaluation. This article studies the small sample
          behavior of several test statistics that are based on
          maximum likelihood estimator, but are designed to perform
          better with nonnormal data. We aim to identify statistics
          that work reasonably well for a range of small sample sizes

          estimator of the variance-covariance matrix in
          heteroskedastic models could be severely biased if the
          design matrix is highly unbalanced. In this paper we,
          therefore, reconsider Rao's (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 65
          (1970) 161) minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimator
          (MINQUE). We derive the analytical expressions for the mean
          squared errors (MSE) of the Eicker-White, one of MacKinnon
          and White's (J. Econometrics 29 (1985) 305) and MINQUE
          estimators, and perform a numerical comparison. Our
          analysis shows that although MINQUE is unbiased by
          construction, it has very large variance particularly for
          the highly unbalanced design matrices. Since the variance
          is the dominant factor in our MSE computation, MINQUE is
          not the preferred estimator in terms of MSE comparison. We
          also studied the finite sample behavior of the confidence

          probabilities based on different variance-covariance matrix

          tests framework (the issue of power maximization by
          maximizing the scores, and relation to the Rao's score/LM
          test is highlighted in that section), to Neyman's smooth
          test, and to Wald, Rao score and Neyman's C(alpha) tests.
          Relations of many classical econometric and statistical
          tests to special cases of the above are given. Additional
          considerations such as one-sided testing or testing when
          nuisance parmaters are not identified under the null, are
          given treatment.

          Bera (2000) then moves on to discuss the issues of
          misspecifications. The earliest discussion of specification
          issue is that between Fisher, E. Pearson and Student about
          underlying normality of the ANOVA-type tests, and fragile
          assumptions required for those to work. A detailed
          analytical treatment is given for tests with locally
          misspecified alternatives: even though the parametric
          constraints imposed by the null might be correct, ignoring
          the nuisance parameters makes the score test behave as
          non-central chi^2, thus having the wrong size.

          Further on, distributional misspecification is considered
          that leads to point quasi-MLE estimators maximizing
          information wrt true distribution, and sandwich-type
          estimators of variance. A review of the literature
          heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation-consistent variance
          estimators in econometrics is given, and corrections to
          Wald and score tests outlined. The information matrix (IM)
          test conludes the paper, and is presented as a version of
          the score test.

          Important philosophical and foundational remarks are spread
          throughout. For instance, in Sec. 3.2 Haavelmo's arguments
          about test construction and fine-tuning with respect to
          possible alternatives are given, and a characterization of
          possible misspecification (type III error) is provided. The
          following broad types are suggested: complete
          misspecification when the DGP is not even in the set of
          assumed alternatives; under-testing when the class of
          assumed alternatives is not rich enough to cover the true
          DGP (testing fewer directions of alternatives than really
          neded); and over-testing with over-specification, when the
          power is diluted in an overparameterized alternative model.
          Another characterizatoin of misspecifications might run
          along the lines of parametric, distributional and
          higher-order moments misspecifications. },

  title     = {The {MM, ME, ML, EL, EF and GMM} approaches to estimation:
          a synthesis},
  abstract  = {The 20th century began on an auspicious statistical note
          with the publication of Karl Pearson's (Philos. Mag. Ser.
          50 (1900) 157) goodness-of-fit test, which is regarded as
          one of the most important scientific breakthroughs. The
          basic motivation behind this test was to see whether an
          assumed probability model adequately described the data at
          hand. Pearson (Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 185
          (1894) 71) also introduced a formal approach to statistical
          estimation through his method of moments (MM) estimation.
          Ronald A. Fisher, while he was a third year undergraduate
          at the Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, suggested the
          maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure as an
          alternative to Pearson's MM approach. In 1922 Fisher
          published a monumental paper that introduced such basic
          concepts as consistency, efficiency, sufficiency--and even
          the term "parameter" with its present meaning. Fisher
          (Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 222 (1922) 309)
          provided the analytical foundation of MLE and studied its
          efficiency relative to the MM estimator. Fisher (J. Roy.
          Statist. Soc. 87 (1924a) 442) established the asymptotic
          equivalence of minimum [chi]2 and ML estimators and wrote
          in favor of using minimum [chi]2 method rather than
          Pearson's MM approach. Recently, econometricians have found
          working under assumed likelihood functions restrictive, and
          have suggested using a generalized version of Pearson's MM
          approach, commonly known as the GMM estimation procedure as
          advocated in Hansen (Econometrica 50 (1982) 1029). Earlier,
          Godambe (Ann. Math. Statist. 31 (1960) 1208) and Durbin (J.
          Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 22 (1960) 139) developed the
          estimating function (EF) approach to estimation that has
          been proven very useful for many statistical models. A
          fundamental result is that score is the optimum EF.
          Ferguson (Ann. Math. Statist. 29 (1958) 1046) considered an
          approach very similar to GMM and showed that estimation
          based on the Pearson [chi]2 statistic is equivalent to
          efficient GMM. Golan et al. (Maximum Entropy Econometrics:
          Robust Estimation with Limited Data. Wiley, New York, 1996)
          developed entropy-based formulation that allowed them to
          solve a wide range of estimation and inference problems in
          econometrics. More recently, Imbens et al. (Econometrica 66
          (1998) 333), Kitamura and Stutzer (Econometrica 65 (1997)
          861) and Mittelhammer et al. (Econometric Foundations.
          Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2000) put GMM within
          the framework of empirical likelihood (EL) and maximum
          entropy (ME) estimation. It can be shown that many of these
          estimation techniques can be obtained as special cases of
          minimizing Cressie and Read (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B
          46 (1984) 440) power divergence criterion that comes
          directly from the Pearson (1900) [chi]2 statistic. In this
          way we are able to assimilate a number of seemingly
          unrelated estimation techniques into a unified framework.},

          randomized and scrambled version of the Halton sequence for

          scrambling of the Halton sequence is motivated by the rapid
          deterioration of the standard Halton sequence's coverage of
          the integration domain in high dimensions of integration.
          The randomization of the sequence is motivated from a need
          to statistically compute the simulation variance of model
          parameters. The resulting hybrid sequence combines the good
          coverage property of quasi-Monte Carlo sequences with the

        {The total survey error (TSE) paradigm provides a theoretical
        framework for optimizing surveys by maximizing data quality within
        budgetary constraints. In this article, the TSE paradigm is viewed as
        part of a much larger design strategy that seeks to optimize surveys
        by maximizing total survey quality; i.e., quality more broadly
        defined to include user-specified dimensions of quality. Survey
        methodology, viewed within this larger framework, alters our
        perspectives on the survey design, implementation, and evaluation. As
        an example, although a major objective of survey design is to
        maximize accuracy subject to costs and timeliness constraints, the
        survey budget must also accommodate additional objectives related to
        relevance, accessibility, interpretability, comparability, coherence,
        and completeness that are critical to a survey's  ? fitness for use.?
        The article considers how the total survey quality approach can be
        extended beyond survey design to include survey implementation and
        evaluation. In doing so, the  ? fitness for use? perspective is shown
        to influence decisions regarding how to reduce survey error during
        design implementation and what sources of error should be evaluated
        in order to assess the survey quality today and to prepare for the
        surveys of the future.},

       regression quantile estimators. The asymptotic covariance
       matrices of his estimators depend on the error densities and
       are therefore difficult to estimate reliably. The difficulty
       may be avoided by applying the bootstrap method (Hahn,
       Econometric Theory 11 (1995) 105–121). Calculation of the
       estimators, however, requires solving a nonsmooth and
       nonconvex minimization problem, resulting in high
       computational costs in implementing the bootstrap. We propose
       in this paper computationally simple resampling methods by
       convexfying Powell's approach in the resampling stage. A
       major advantage of the new methods is that they can be
       implemented by efficient linear programming. Simulation
       studies show that the methods are reliable even with moderate

  abstract  = {Many concepts in sociology are difficult or impossible to
          objectively measure. This limitation forces a reliance on
          subjective measures that typically contain both systematic
          and random measurement errors. Systematic errors, or
          \&quot;biases,\&quot; are the focus of this paper. Campbell
          and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research
          design is the best known social scientific procedure for
          uncovering systematic errors, but the data requirements for
          classical MTMM designs are too demanding for many areas of
          sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We show
          that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under
          more relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how
          researchers can examine the determinants of systematic
          errors and gain insights into the potential for confounding
          or spurious effects caused by systematic errors. We
          demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the
          subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several
          recent ASR papers and provide additional examples,
          including measures of the reputational quality of graduate
          programs and job evaluations for comparable-worth
          investigations. We conclude that sociologists can do far
          more to understand the systematic error present in their
          subjective variables.},

          liberal democracy. Specifically, my purposes are (1) to
          propose a working definition of liberal democracy; (2) to
          outline a theory of ``method factors'' in
          subjective measures of liberal democracy; (3) to provide
          the first estimates of the proportion of variance due to
          systematic error, validity, and random error in commonly
          used measures; (4) to replicate these results across
          several years; and (5) to estimate the degree of liberal
          democracy in more than 150 countries. All but one measure
          contain systematic error, and in some cases the bias
          component is large. Furthermore, a new liberal democracy
          index has a .96 squared correlation with the liberal
          democracy latent variable and has negligible correlations
          with the method factors that are present in the individual
          indicators. The results suggest that the current practice
          of treating unadjusted democracy indicators as error free
          can be misleading.}

          variables (IVs) in estimating factor analysis and latent
          variable models such as structural equations models. Bollen
          (1996) suggested a two-stage least squares (2SLS) technique
          that makes use of model-implied IVs in estimating the
          measurement and latent variable models. Model-implied
          instrumental variables are the observed variables in the
          model that can serve as instrumental variables in a given
          equation. One difficulty inhibiting the practical use of
          the 2SLS estimator is identifying the model-implied IVs.
          The authors provide a simple procedure that identifies the
          model-implied IVs and a computer algorithm that can easily
          be implemented to automate the selection of IVs for
          simultaneous equations, factor analysis, and latent
          variable models. 10.1177/0049124103260341}

        {This paper examines how permanent income and other components of socio-economic status ({SES}) are related to fertility in less developed countries. Because permanent income cannot be measured directly, we employ a latent-variable method. We compare our results with those of the more common proxy-variable method and investigate the consequences of not accounting for measurement error. Using data from Ghana and Peru, we find that permanent income has a large, negative influence on fertility and that research must take the latent nature of permanent income into account to uncover its influence. Controlling for measurement error in the proxies for permanent income can also lead to substantial changes in the estimated effects of control variables. Finally, we examine which of the common proxies for permanent income most closely capture the concept. The results have implications beyond this specific dependent variable, providing evidence on the sensitivity of microanalyses to the treatment of long-term economic status.},

          Simulated data are used to assess bias, efficiency, and

          polychoric instrumental variable (PIV) estimator to use in
          structural equation models (SEMs) with categorical observed

          estimator for continuous variables to categorical

          asymptotic standard errors for the regression coefficients

          provide an estimator of the variance and covariance
          parameters of the model, asymptotic standard errors for
          these, and test statistics of overall model fit. We examine
          this estimator via an empirical study and also via a small

  title     = {Detection and Determinants of Bias in Subjective
          Measures},
  abstract  = {Many concepts in sociology are difficult or impossible to
          objectively measure. This limitation forces a reliance on
          subjective measures that typically contain both systematic
          and random measurement errors. Systematic errors, or
          \&quot;biases,\&quot; are the focus of this paper. Campbell
          and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research
          design is the best known social scientific procedure for
          uncovering systematic errors, but the data requirements for
          classical MTMM designs are too demanding for many areas of
          sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We show
          that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under
          more relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how
          researchers can examine the determinants of systematic
          errors and gain insights into the potential for confounding
          or spurious effects caused by systematic errors. We
          demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the
          subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several
          recent ASR papers and provide additional examples,
          including measures of the reputational quality of graduate
          programs and job evaluations for comparable-worth
          investigations. We conclude that sociologists can do far
          more to understand the systematic error present in their
          subjective variables.},

          theory-testing rather than a model-generating approach.

  abstract  = {In fields such as biology, medical sciences, sociology,
          and economics researchers often face the situation where
          the number of available observations, or the amount of
          available information, is sufficiently small that
          approximations based on the normal distribution may be
          unreliable. Theoretical work over the last quarter-century
          has led to new likelihood-based methods that lead to very
          accurate approximations in finite samples, but this work
          has had limited impact on statistical practice. This book
          illustrates by means of realistic examples and case studies
          how to use the new theory, and investigates how and when it
          makes a difference to the resulting inference. The
          treatment is oriented towards practice and comes with code
          in the R language (available from the web) which enables
          the methods to be applied in a range of situations of
          interest to practitioners. The analysis includes some
          comparisons of higher order likelihood inference with
          bootstrap or Bayesian methods. Author resource page:

    abstract =
       {Post-stratification is frequently used to improve the
       precision of survey estimators when categorical auxiliary
       information is available from sources outside the survey. In
       natural resource surveys, such information is often obtained
       from remote sensing data, classified into categories and
       displayed as pixel-based maps. These maps may be constructed
       based on classification models fitted to the sample data.
       Post-stratification of the sample data based on categories
       derived from the sample data (``endogenous
       post-stratification'') violates the standard
       post-stratification assumptions that observations are
       classified without error into post-strata, and post-stratum
       population counts are known. Properties of the endogenous
       post-stratification estimator are derived for the case of a
       sample-fitted generalized linear model, from which the
       post-strata are constructed by dividing the range of the
       model predictions into predetermined intervals. Design
       consistency of the endogenous post-stratification estimator
       is established under mild conditions. Under a superpopulation
       model, consistency and asymptotic normality of the endogenous
       post-stratification estimator are established, showing that
       it has the same asymptotic variance as the traditional
       post-stratified estimator with fixed strata. Simulation
       experiments demonstrate that the practical effect of first
       fitting a model to the survey data before post-stratifying is
       small, even for relatively small sample sizes.},

          equivalence scale, a method for estimating economic

          pp. 799–801) and Bellhouse and Stafford (Statist. Sin. 9
          (1999) 407–424); this estimator incorporates both the
          sampling weights and the kernel weights. We present
          regularity conditions which lead the sample estimator to be
          consistent and asymptotically normal under various modes of
          inference used with sample survey data. We also introduce a
          superpopulation structure for model-based inference that
          allows the population model to reflect naturally occurring
          clustering. The estimator, and confidence bands derived
          from the sampling design, are illustrated using data from
          the US National Crime Victimization Survey and the US
          National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:Multilevel models (MLM) offer complex survey
          data analysts a unique approach to understanding individual
          and contextual determinants of public health. However,
          little summarized guidance exists with regard to fitting
          MLM in complex survey data with design weights. Simulation
          work suggests that analysts should scale design weights
          using two methods and fit the MLM using unweighted and
          scaled-weighted data. This article examines the performance
          of scaled-weighted and unweighted analyses across a variety
          of MLM and software programs.METHODS:Using data from the
          2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health
          Care Needs (NS-CSHCN: n = 40,723) that collected data from
          children clustered within states, I examine the performance
          of scaling methods across outcome type (categorical vs.
          continuous), model type (level-1, level-2, or combined),
          and software (Mplus, MLwiN, and GLLAMM).RESULTS:Scaled
          weighted estimates and standard errors differed slightly
          from unweighted analyses, agreeing more with each other
          than with unweighted analyses. However, observed
          differences were minimal and did not lead to different
          inferential conclusions. Likewise, results demonstrated
          minimal differences across software programs, increasing
          confidence in results and inferential conclusions
          independent of software choice.CONCLUSION:If including
          design weights in MLM, analysts should scale the weights
          and use software that properly includes the scaled weights
          in the estimation.},

          covariance matrix estimator or the empirical covariance
          matrix estimator, has achieved increasing use with the
          growing popularity of generalized estimating equations. Its
          virtue is that it provides consistent estimates of the
          covariance matrix for parameter estimates even when a
          parametric model fails to hold, or is not even specified.
          Surprisingly though, there has been little discussion of
          the properties of the sandwich method other than
          consistency. We investigate the sandwich estimator in
          quasilikelihood models asymptotically, and in the linear
          case analytically. We show that when the quasilikelihood
          model is correct, the sandwich covariance matrix estimate
          is often far more variable than the usual parametric
          variance estimate, and its coverage probabilities can be
          abysmal. The increased variance is a fixed feature of the
          method, and the price one pays to obtain consistency even
          when the parametric model fails. We make some simple
          suggestions for modifying the method which improve coverage
          probabilities.}

        distribution of the target variable given the covariates. This avoids
        the problems associated with specification of random effects,
        allowing inter-area differences to be characterised by area-specific
        M-quantile coefficients. The proposed approach is easily made robust
        against outlying data values and can be adapted for estimation of a
        wide range of area-specific parameters, including quantiles of the
        distribution of the target variable in the different small areas. The
        differences between M-quantile and random effects models are
        discussed and the alternative approaches to small area estimation are
        compared using both simulated and real data.},

    abstract =
        {When we estimate the population total for a survey variable
        or variables, calibration forces the weighted estimates of
        certain covariates to match known or alternatively estimated
        population totals called benchmarks. Calibration can be used
        to correct for sample-survey nonresponse, or for coverage
        error resulting from frame undercoverage or unit
        duplication. The quasi-randomization theory supporting its
        use in nonresponse adjustment treats response as an
        additional phase of random sampling. The functional form of
        a quasi-random response model is assumed to be known, its
        parameter values estimated implicitly through the creation
        of calibration weights. Unfortunately, calibration depends
        upon known benchmark totals while the covariates in a
        plausible model for survey response may not be the benchmark
        covariates. Moreover, it may be prudent to keep the number
        of covariates in a response model small. We use calibration
        to adjust for nonresponse when the benchmark model and
        covariates may differ, provided the number of the former is
        at least as great as that of the latter. We discuss the
        estimation of a total for a vector of survey variables that
        do not include the benchmark covariates, but that may
        include some of the model covariates. We show how to measure
        both the additional asymptotic variance due to the
        nonresponse in a calibration-weighted estimator and the full
        asymptotic variance of the estimator itself. All variances
        are determined with respect to the randomization mechanism
        used to select the sample, the response model generating the
        subset of sample respondents, or both. Data from the U.S.
        National Agricultural Statistical Service's 2002 Census of
        Agriculture and simulations are used to illustrate
        alternative adjustments for nonresponse. The paper concludes
        with some remarks about adjustment for coverage error.},

          involves constrained maximization, is a key step in
          applications of empirical likelihood. However, in some
          situations, the required numerical problem has no solution.
          In this case, the convention is to assign a zero value to
          the profile empirical likelihood. This strategy has at
          least two limitations. First, it is numerically difficult

          are found to have coverage probabilities closer to the
          nominal levels without employing complex procedures such as
          Bartlett correction or bootstrap calibration. The method is

          The other two (the embedded model and the indeterminate

  title     = {Estimating a Multinomial Probit Model of Brand Choice
          Using the Method of Simulated Moments},
  abstract  = {The multinomial probit model of brand choice is
          theoretically appealing for marketing applications as it is
          free from the \&quot;independence of irrelevant
          alternatives\&quot; property of the multinomial logit
          model. However, difficulties in estimation have restricted
          its widespread use in marketing. This paper presents an
          application of the method of simulated moments, a new
          methodology that enables easy estimation of probit models
          with a large number of alternatives in the choice set. We
          describe the theoretical development of the technique and
          using pseudo-simulated data, conduct numerical experiments
          to compare the method with existing techniques for
          estimating probit models. Using the scanner panel data on
          the purchases of catsup, we provide an empirical
          application of the method of simulated moments to the
          estimation of the parameters of a multinomial probit model.
          Estimating the covariance structure associated with the
          underlying latent variable probit model enables us to
          identify broad patterns of similarities across
          alternatives. It also enables us to derive a pairwise
          similarity matrix across choice alternatives which when
          input into a multidimensional scaling routine provides us
          with a graphical representation of competitive structure in
          the catsup market. For completeness, we compare the
          substantive implications for the effects of marketing
          variables obtained from the multinomial probit model with
          those obtained from models in the extant marketing
          literature.},

          statistics in covariance structure analysis has concluded
          that test statistics and standard errors are biased under
          severe non-normality. An estimation procedure known as
          asymptotic distribution free (ADF), making no
          distributional assumption, has been suggested to avoid
          these biases. Corrections to the normal theory statistics
          to yield more adequate performance have also been proposed.
          This study compares the performance of a scaled test
          statistic and robust standard errors for two models under
          several non-normal conditions and also compares these with
          the results from ML and ADF methods. Both ML and ADF test
          statistics performed rather well in one model and
          considerably worse in the other. In general, the scaled
          test statistic seemed to behave better than the ML test
          statistic and the ADF statistic performed the worst. The
          robust and ADF standard errors yielded more appropriate
          estimates of sampling variability than the ML standard
          errors, which were usually downward biased, in both models
          under most of the non-normal conditions. ML test statistics
          and standard errors were found to be quite robust to the
          violation of the normality assumption when data had either
          symmetric and platykurtic distributions, or non-symmetric
          and zero kurtotic distributions.}

  volume={44},

  pages={803--827},
  year={2009},
  abstract ={
    The noncentral chi-square approximation of the distribution of
    the likelihood ratio (LR) test statistic is a critical part of
    the methodology in structural equation modeling. Recently, it
    was argued by some authors that in certain situations normal
    distributions may give a better approximation of the
    distribution of the LR test statistic. The main goal of this
    article is to evaluate the validity of employing these
    distributions in practice. Monte Carlo simulation results
    indicate that the noncentral chi-square distribution describes
    behavior of the LR test statistic well under small, moderate,
    and even severe misspecifications regardless of the sample size
    (as long as it is sufficiently large), whereas the normal
    distribution, with a bias correction, gives a slightly better
    approximation for extremely severe misspecifications. However,
    neither the noncentral chi-square distribution nor the
    theoretical normal distributions give a reasonable approximation
    of the LR test statistics under extremely severe
    misspecifications. Of course, extremely misspecified models are
    not of much practical interest. We also use the Thurstone data
    (Thurstone & Thurstone, 1941) from a classic study of mental
    ability for our illustration. }

        calibrating the crimes avoided by incarceration of individuals
        convicted of drug offenses compared to those convicted of nondrug
        offenses. Two methods for constructing reference priors for
        hierarchical models both lead to the same prior in the final model.
        We use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit the model to data from
        a random sample of past arrest records of all felons convicted of
        drug trafficking, drug possession, robbery, or burglary in Los
        Angeles County in 1986 and 1990. The value of this formal analysis,
        as opposed to a simpler analysis that does not use the formal
        machinery of a Bayesian hierarchical model, is to provide interval
        estimates that account for the uncertainty due to the random effects.

                  The noncentral chi-square distribution plays a key
                  role in structural equation modeling
                  (SEM).  The likelihood ratio test statistic that
                  accompanies virtually all SEMs
                  asymptotically follows a noncentral chi-square
                  under certain assumptions relating to
                  misspecification and multivariate distribution.
                  Many scholars use the noncentral chi-square
                  distribution in the construction of fit indices,
                  such as Steiger and Lind?s (1980) Root Mean
                  Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) or the
                  family of baseline fit indices (e.g., RNI,
                  CFI), and for the computation of statistical power
                  for model hypothesis testing.  Despite this
                  wide use, surprisingly little is known about the
                  extent to which the test statistic follows a
                  noncentral chi-square in applied research.  Our
                  study examines several hypotheses about the
                  suitability of the noncentral chi-square
                  distribution for the usual SEM test statistic
                  under                  conditions commonly
                  encountered in practice.  We designed Monte Carlo
                  computer                  simulation experiments
                  to empirically test these research hypotheses.
                  Our experimental                  conditions
                  included seven sample sizes ranging from 50 to
                  1000, and three distinct model
                  types, each with five specifications ranging from
                  a correct model to the severely misspecified
                  uncorrelated baseline model.  In general, we found
                  that for models with small to moderate
                  misspecification, the noncentral chi-square
                  distribution is well approximated when the
                  sample size is large (e.g., greater than 200), but
                  there was evidence of bias in both mean and
                  variance in smaller samples.  A key finding was
                  that the test statistics for the uncorrelated
                  variable baseline model did not follow the
                  noncentral chi-square distribution for any model
                  type across any sample size.  We discuss the
                  implications of our findings for the SEM fit
                  indices and power estimation procedures that are
                  based on the noncentral chi-square
                  distribution as well as potential directions for
                  future research.

  title     = {Have Multilevel Models Been Structural Equation Models All
          Along?},
  abstract  = {A core assumption of the standard multiple regression
          model is independence of residuals, the violation of which
          results in biased standard errors and test statistics. The
          structural equation model (SEM) generalizes the regression
          model in several key ways, but the SEM also assumes
          independence of residuals. The multilevel model (MLM) was
          developed to extend the regression model to dependent data
          structures. Attempts have been made to extend the SEM in
          similar ways, but several complications currently limit the
          general application of these techniques in practice.
          Interestingly, it is well known that under a broad set of
          conditions SEM and MLM longitudinal ?growth curve? models
          are analytically and empirically identical. This is
          intriguing given the clear violation of independence in
          growth modeling that does not detrimentally affect the
          standard SEM. Better understanding the source and potential
          implications of this isomorphism is my focus here. I begin
          by exploring why SEM and MLM are analytically equivalent
          methods in the presence of nesting due to repeated
          observations over time. I then capitalize on this
          equivalency to allow for the extension of SEMs to a general
          class of nested data structures. I conclude with a
          description of potential opportunities for multilevel SEMs
          and directions for future developments.},

          early sample of tax returns, and the final data set is the
          sample after all tax returns have been processed. The new
          methods estimate a predicted propensity for late filing for
          each return in the advance sample and then poststratify
          based on these propensity scores. Using advance and
          complete sample data for 1982, we demonstrate that the new
          methods produce advance estimates generally much closer to
          the final estimates than those derived from the current
          advance estimation techniques. The results demonstrate the
          value of propensity modeling, a general-purpose methodology
          that can be applied to a wide range of problems, including
          adjustment for unit nonresponse and frame undercoverage as

          Analyses under Informative Dropout},
  abstract  = {Pattern mixture models are frequently used to analyze
          longitudinal data where missingness is induced by dropout.
          For measured responses, it is typical to model the complete
          data as a mixture of multivariate normal distributions,
          where mixing is done over the dropout distribution. Fully
          parameterized pattern mixture models are not identified by
          incomplete data; Little (1993, Journal of the American
          Statistical Association 88, 125-134) has characterized
          several identifying restrictions that can be used for model
          fitting. We propose a reparameterization of the pattern
          mixture model that allows investigation of sensitivity to
          assumptions about nonidentified parameters in both the mean
          and variance, allows consideration of a wide range of
          nonignorable missing-data mechanisms, and has intuitive
          appeal for eliciting plausible missing-data mechanisms. The
          parameterization makes clear an advantage of pattern
          mixture models over parametric selection models, namely
          that the missing-data mechanism can be varied without
          affecting the marginal distribution of the observed data.
          To illustrate the utility of the new parameterization, we
          analyze data from a recent clinical trial of growth hormone
          for maintaining muscle strength in the elderly. Dropout
          occurs at a high rate and is potentially informative. We
          undertake a detailed sensitivity analysis to understand the
          impact of missing-data assumptions on the inference about
          the effects of growth hormone on muscle strength.},

          That is a powerful attraction: the ability to visualize

          geometry is, fundamentally, a determination of point

          A space of probability densities is defined and endowed

          hypothesis ? = 0 against the alternative \$\xi > 0\$ . If
          the distribution does not depend on ? when ? = 0,
          standard asymptotic methods such as likelihood ratio
          testing or C(?) testing are not directly applicable.
          However, these methods may, under appropriate conditions,
          be used to reduce the problem to one involving inference
          from a Gaussian process. This simplified problem is
          examined and a test which may be derived as a likelihood
          ratio test or from the union-intersection principle is
          introduced. Approximate expressions for the significance
          level and power are obtained.}

  abstract  = {In survey sampling, Taylor linearization is often used to
          obtain variance estimators for calibration estimators of
          totals and nonlinear finite population (or census)
          parameters, such as ratios, regression and correlation
          coefficients, which can be expressed as smooth functions of
          totals. Taylor linearization is generally applicable to any
          sampling design, but it can lead to multiple variance
          estimators that are asymptotically design unbiased under
          repeated sampling. The choice among the variance estimators
          requires other considerations such as (i) approximate
          unbiasedness for the model variance of the estimator under
          an assumed model, (ii) validity under a conditional
          repeated sampling framework. In this paper, a new approach
          to deriving Taylor linearization variance estimators is
          proposed. It leads directly to a variance estimator which
          satisfies the above considerations at least in a number of
          important cases. The method is applied to a variety of
          problems, covering estimators of a total as well as other
          estimators defined either explicitly or implicitly as
          solutions of estimating equations. In particular,
          estimators of logistic regression parameters with
          calibration weights are studied. It leads to a new variance
          estimator for a general class of calibration estimators
          that includes generalized raking ratio and generalized
          regression estimators. The proposed method is extended to
          two-phase sampling to obtain a variance estimator that
          makes fuller use of the first phase sample data compared to
          traditional linearization variance estimators.}

        with unequal probabilities is proposed. It consists of splitting the
        inclusion probability vector into several new inclusion probability
        vectors. One of these vectors is chosen randomly; thus, the initial
        problem is reduced to another sampling problem with unequal
        probabilities. This splitting is then repeated on these new vectors
        of inclusion probabilities; at each step, the sampling problem is
        reduced to a simpler problem. The simplicity of this technique allows
        one to generate easily new sampling procedures with unequal
        probabilities. The splitting method also generalises well-known
        methods such as the Midzuno method, the elimination procedure and the
        Chao procedure. Next, a sufficient condition is given in order that a
        splitting method satisfies the {Sen-Yates}-Grundy condition. Finally,

  title     = {On Adjustments Based on the Signed of the Empirical
          Likelihood Ratio Statistic},
  abstract  = {The standard multivariate normal approximation to the
          distribution of the signed root of the empirical likelihood
          ratio statistic is considered in cases where inference is
          required for a smooth function of the mean of the
          distribution from which the sample is drawn. The error in
          this approximation is of order O(n-1/2), where n is the
          sample size, and it is shown that the error can be reduced
          to order O(n-1) by using a mean adjustment. When a scalar
          parameter is of interest, use of the mean adjustment
          produces confidence intervals whose endpoints each have
          coverage error of order O(n-1). This is in contrast to use
          of the unadjusted signed root, or equivalently, use of the
          chi-squared approximation for the empirical likelihood
          ratio statistic, which produces one-sided limits having
          coverage error of order O(n-1/2). For a vector parameter of
          interest, a procedure asymptotically equivalent to the mean
          adjustment is developed that avoids explicit calculation of
          the signed square root. It is argued for the scalar
          parameter case that the coverage error of one-sided limits
          can be further reduced to O(n-3/2) by use of both mean and

  abstract  = {It is shown that, in a very general setting, the empirical
          likelihood method for constructing confidence intervals is
          Bartlett-correctable. This means that a simple adjustment
          for the expected value of log-likelihood ratio reduces
          coverage error to an extremely low O(n-2), where n denotes
          sample size. That fact makes empirical likelihood
          competitive with methods such as the bootstrap which are
          not Bartlett-correctable and which usually have coverage
          error of size n-1. Most importantly, our work demonstrates
          a strong link between empirical likelihood and parametric
          likelihood, since the Bartlett correction had previously
          only been available for parametric likelihood. A general
          formula is given for the Bartlett correction, valid in a
          very wide range of problems, including estimation of mean,
          variance, covariance, correlation, skewness, kurtosis, mean
          ratio, mean difference, variance ratio, etc. The efficacy
          of the correction is demonstrated in a simulation study for
          the case of the mean.}

          properties of genuine parametric likelihood, but it is
          computationally burdensome, especially when nuisance
          parameters are present. This paper presents two
          approximations to the profile empirical likelihood function
          for a scalar parameter of interest in the context of
          M-estimation; the simpler approximation is based on the
          third derivative of the profile log empirical likelihood
          function at its maximising point, while the more accurate
          approximation involves both the third and fourth
          derivatives.Formulae are given for these higher-order
          derivatives that can be evaluated using ordinary matrix
          operations, so computation of the approximations is very
          easy. The accuracy of the approximations is demonstrated in
          several numerical examples. The computational simplicity of
          the approximations makes it feasible to use them in
          conjunction with bootstrap calibration for constructing
          accurate confidence intervals and limits. The derivatives
          are also helpful for exploring the shape of the profile log
          empirical likelihood function and for determining suitable
          parameterisations for studentised statistics.

  title     = {On adjustments based on the signed root of the empirical
          likelihood ratio statistic},
  abstract  = {The standard multivariate normal approximation to the
          distribution of the signed root of the empirical likelihood
          ratio statistic is considered in cases where inference is
          required for a smooth function of the mean of the
          distribution from which the sample is drawn. The error in
          this approximation is of order O(n-[1/2]) where n is the
          sample size, and it is shown that the error can be reduced
          to order O(n-1) by using a mean adjustment. When a scalar
          parameter is of interest, use of the mean adjustment
          produces confidence intervals whose endpoints each have
          coverage error of order O(n-1). This is in contrast to use
          of the unadjusted signed root, or equivalently, use of the
          chi-squared approximation for the empirical likelihood
          ratio statistic, which produces one-sided limits having
          coverage error of order O(n-[1/2]). For a vector parameter
          of interest, a procedure asymptotically equivalent to the
          mean adjustment is developed that avoids explicit
          calculation of the signed square root. It is argued for the
          scalar parameter case that the coverage error of one-sided
          limits can be further reduced to O(n-3/2 by use of both
          mean and variance adjustments. The variance adjustment is
          given in the case when a scalar mean is of interest. The
          coverage accuracy of confidence limits obtained by the
          various methods is illustrated by simulation.

  title     = {Informative Drop-Out in Longitudinal Data Analysis},
  abstract  = {A model is proposed for continuous longitudinal data with
          non-ignorable or informative drop-out (ID). The model
          combines a multivariate linear model for the underlying
          response with a logistic regression model for the drop-out
          process. The latter incorporates dependence of the
          probability of drop-out on unobserved, or missing,
          observations. Parameters in the model are estimated by
          using maximum likelihood (ML) and inferences drawn through
          conventional likelihood procedures. In particular,
          likelihood ratio tests can be used to assess the
          informativeness of the drop-out process through comparison
          of the full model with reduced models corresponding to
          random drop-out (RD) and completely random processes. A
          simulation study is used to assess the procedure in two
          settings: the comparison of time trends under a linear
          regression model with autocorrelated errors and the
          estimation of period means and treatment differences from a
          four-period four-treatment crossover trial. It is seen in
          both settings that, when data are generated under an ID
          process, the ML estimators from the ID model do not suffer
          from the bias that is present in the ordinary least squares
          and RD ML estimators. The approach is then applied to three
          examples. These derive from a milk protein trial involving
          three groups of cows, milk yield data from a study of
          mastitis in dairy cattle and data from a multicentre
          clinical trial on the study of depression. All three
          examples provide evidence of an underlying ID process, two
          with some strength. It is seen that the assumption of an ID
          rather than an RD process has practical implications for
          the interpretation of the data.},

      { Background:Many studies in psychological and educational research
      aim to estimate population average treatment effects (PATE) using
      data from large complex survey samples, and many of these studies use
      propensity score methods. Recent advances have investigated how to
      incorporate survey weights with propensity score methods. However, to
      this point, that work had not been well summarized, and it was not
      clear how much difference the different PATE estimation methods would
      make empirically.Purpose:The purpose of this study is to
      systematically summarize the appropriate use of survey weights in
      propensity score analysis of complex survey data and use a case study
      to empirically compare the PATE estimates using multiple analysis
      methods that include ordinary least squares regression, weighted
      least squares regression, and various propensity score
      applications.Methods:We first summarize various propensity score
      methods that handle survey weights. We then demonstrate the
      performance of various analysis methods using a nationally
      representative data set, the Early Childhood Longitudinal
      Study–Kindergarten to estimate the effects of preschool on children’s
      academic achievement. The correspondence of the results was evaluated
      using multiple criteria.Results and Conclusions:It is important for
      researchers to think carefully about their estimand of interest and
      use methods appropriate for that estimand. If interest is in drawing
      inferences to the survey target population, it is important to take
      the survey weights into account, particularly in the outcome analysis
      stage for estimating the PATE. The case study shows, however, not
      much difference among various analysis methods in one applied
      example.}

  title     = {Assessing the accuracy of the maximum likelihood
          estimator: Observed versus expected Fisher information},
  abstract  = {This paper concerns normal approximations to the
          distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator in
          one-parameter families. The traditional variance
          approximation is 1/[\&\#167;], where {theta} is the maximum
          likelihood estimator and [\&\#167;] is the expected total
          Fisher information. Many writers, including R. A. Fisher,
          have argued in favour of the variance estimate 1/I(x),
          where I(x) is the observed information, i.e. minus the
          second derivative of the log likelihood function at {theta}
          given data x. We give a frequentist justification for
          preferring 1/I(x) to 1/[\&\#167;]. The former is shown to
          approximate the conditional variance of 8 given an
          appropriate ancillary statistic which to a first
          approximation is I(x). The theory may be seen to flow
          naturally from Fisher's pioneering papers on likelihood
          estimation. A large number of examples are used to
          supplement a small amount of theory. Our evidence indicates
          preference for the likelihood ratio method of obtaining
          confidence limits. 10.1093/biomet/65.3.457},
  comment   = {This is a deep and wonderful paper that can be discussed
          for at least three weeks in a serious statistical
          theory/asymptotics class. The class of problems considered
          is when the likelihood affords an ancillary or an
          approximately ancillary statistic in a (curved) exponential
          family setting.

          The authors show that in some examples when the finite
          sample distribution of the main statistic given the
          ancillary is known, the variance of the former is better
          approximated by the observed information rather than Fisher
          (expected) information. In some cases an exact equality is
          achieved (Cox' 1958 example with two unbiased instruments
          that have different variances). They suggest the
          generalization: conditioning on ancillary statistic when
          one is available gives more meaningful measure of
          variability than the expected information; we would want to
          use this extra information, anyway!

          In translation families, the shape of the conditional
          distribution of the main statistic given the ancillary can
          be derived directly from the likelihood (although the
          normalizing constant has to be found by integration). When
          that conditional distribution is normal, the variance is
          given by the observed information. In the general
          non-normal case, an approximation can be obtained with
          higher order derivatives of the log-likelihood. Explicit
          expressions for the first two conditional moments are
          derived. The main term of the approximation for the
          variance is the observed information, and the relative size
          of the remainder is \$O\_p(n^{-1})\$ (Lemma 1).

          The relation between the observed and expected information
          is obtained as a function of statistical curvature (Efron
          1975). The curvature shows the deviation of the density
          from an exponential family, and is obtained as a somewhat
          involved function of the fist two dervatives of the
          log-density. The ratio of the observed to the expected
          information is asymptotically normal (with the scaling
          factor of \$\sqrt{n}\$), with the asymptotic variance being
          squared curvature.

          The next section considers confidence intervals for the
          location parameter. Higher order approximations are
          obtained for the p-values of the Wald test that uses the
          observed information, and the likelihood ratio, both
          conditional on the ancillary statistic. They are also
          compared to the unconditional Wald test based on the
          expected information. In simulations, it was shown that the
          LRT has the best performance of them all. The Wald test
          with the observed information tends to overreject; it is
          not clear how to qualify the performance of an
          unconditional test in this situation.

          For the non-translational families, an approximate
          asymptotic ancillary statistic is suggested, as a function
          of the observed and expected information, and the
          curvature. It leads to a local reparameterization with
          conditioning on this statistic, which in turn leads to
          better asymptotic normality of the main statistic in the
          new coordinates. An example is bivariate standard normal
          distribution: the new construction leads to the Fisher's
          variance stabilizing z-transformation!

          For curved exponential families, the proposed ancillary
          statistic has the interpretation of (Mahalanobis)
          distance/length of the projection from the sufficient
          statistic to the family.},

  abstract  = {Correlated data frequently arise in contexts such as, for
          example, repeated measures and meta-analysis. The amount of
          information in such data depends not only on the sample
          size, but also on the structure and strength of the
          correlations among observations from the same independent
          block. A general concept is discussed, the effective sample
          size, as a way of quantifying the amount of information in
          such data. It is defined as the sample size one would need
          in an independent sample to equal the amount of information
          in the actual correlated sample. This concept is widely
          applicable, for Gaussian data and beyond, and provides
          important insight. For example, it helps explain why
          fixed-effects and random-effects inferences of
          meta-analytic data can be so radically divergent. Further,
          we show that in some cases the amount of information is

          block approaches infinity. We use the method to devise a
          new denominator degrees-of-freedom method for fixed-effects
          testing. It is compared to the classical Satterthwaite and
          Kenward–Roger methods for performance and, more
          importantly, to enhance insight. A key feature of the
          proposed degrees-of-freedom method is that it, unlike the
          others, can be used for non-Gaussian data, too.},

  abstract  = {Rubin has offered multiple imputation as a general
          approach to inference from survey data sets with missing
          values filled in through imputation. In many situations the
          multiple imputation variance estimator is consistent. In
          turn, this observation has lent support to a number of
          complex applications. In fact, however, the multiple
          imputation variance estimator is inconsistent under some
          simple conditions. This article extends previous work of
          Rao and Shao and of Fay directed toward consistent variance
          estimation under wider conditions. Extensions of Rao and
          Shao's results to fractionally weighted imputation combines
          the estimation efficiency of multiple imputation and the
          consistency of the Rao-Shao variance estimator.}

          reached negative conclusions about the use of
          non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose
          of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues

          in the literature and extending the theory from functions
          of the sample mean to include functions of the between and
          within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to
          include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the

          depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap
          giving consistency under the transformation model whereas
          the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both
          the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition

          consistency.}

  title     = {An Analysis of Sample Attrition in Panel Data: The
          Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics},
  abstract  = {By 1989 the Michigan Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID)
          had experienced approximately 50 percent sample loss from
          cumulative attrition from its initial 1968 membership. We
          study the effect of this attrition on the unconditional
          distributions of several socioeconomic variables and on the
          estimates of several sets of regression coefficients. We
          provide a statistical framework for conducting tests for
          attrition bias that draws a sharp distinction between
          selection on unobservables and on observables and that
          shows that weighted least squares can generate consistent
          parameter estimates when selection is based on observables,
          even when they are endogenous. Our empirical analysis shows
          that attrition is highly selective and is concentrated
          among lower socioeconomic status individuals. We also show
          that attrition is concentrated among those with more
          unstable earnings, marriage, and migration histories.
          Nevertheless, we find that these variables explain very
          little of the attrition in the sample, and that the
          selection that occurs is moderated by
          regression-to-the-mean effects from selection on transitory
          components that fade over time. Consequently, despite the
          large amount of attrition, we find no strong evidence that
          attrition has seriously distorted the representativeness of
          the PSID through 1989, and considerable evidence that its
          cross-sectional representativeness has remained roughly
          intact.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on the monotone missing data patterns
          produced by dropouts and presents a review of the
          statistical literature on approaches for handling dropouts
          in longitudinal clinical trials. A variety of ad hoc
          procedures for handling dropouts are widely used. The
          rationale for many of these procedures is not well-founded
          and they can result in biased estimates of treatment
          comparisons. A fundamentally difficult problem arises when
          the probability of dropout is thought to be related to the
          specific value that in principle should have been obtained;
          this is often referred to as informative or non-ignorable
          dropout. Joint models for the longitudinal outcomes and the
          dropout times have been proposed in order to make
          corrections for non-ignorable dropouts. Two broad classes
          of joint models are reviewed: selection models and
          pattern-mixture models. Finally, when there are dropouts in
          a longitudinal clinical trial the goals of the analysis
          need to be clearly specified. In this paper we review the
          main distinctions between a "pragmatic" and an
          "explanatory"" analysis. We note that many of the
          procedures for handling dropouts that are widely used in
          practice come closest to producing an explanatory rather
          than a pragmatic analysis. {\copyright} VVS, 2003.},

          simple method based on generalized linear mixture models
          for handling nonignorable dropouts for a variety of
          discrete and continuous outcomes. Statistical inference for
          the model parameters is based on a generalized estimating
          equations (GEE) approach (Liang and Zeger, 1986). The
          proposed method yields estimates of the model parameters
          that are valid when nonresponse is nonignorable under a
          variety of assumptions concerning the dropout process.
          Furthermore, the proposed method can be implemented using
          widely available statistical software. Finally, an example
          using data from a clinical trial of contracepting women is
          used to illustrate the methodology.

          that standard methods of model comparison are inappropriate
          for comparing ignorable and non-ignorable models.
          Uncertainty about ignorability of non-response is
          incorporated by introducing parameters describing the
          extent of non-ignorability into a pattern mixture
          specification and integrating over the prior uncertainty
          associated with these parameters. Our approach is
          illustrated using polling data from the 1992 British

          adjustments for surveys when non-ignorable non-response is

  abstract  = {Cluster analysis is the automated search for groups of
          related observations in a dataset. Most clustering done in
          practice is based largely on heuristic but intuitively
          reasonable procedures, and most clustering methods
          available in commercial software are also of this type.
          However, there is little systematic guidance associated
          with these methods for solving important practical
          questions that arise in cluster analysis, such as how many
          clusters are there, which clustering method should be used,
          and how should outliers be handled. We review a general
          methodology for model-based clustering that provides a
          principled statistical approach to these issues. We also
          show that this can be useful for other problems in
          multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and
          multivariate density estimation. We give examples from
          medical diagnosis, minefield detection, cluster recovery

          models for causation, having a bit less than the usual
          complement of hypothetical counterfactuals. Assuming the
          invariance of error distributions may be essential for
          causal inference, but the errors themselves need not be
          invariant. Graphs can be interpreted using conditional
          distributions, so that we can better address connections
          between the mathematical framework and causality in the
          world. The identification problem is posed in terms of
          conditionals. As will be seen, causal relationships cannot
          be inferred from a data set by running regressions unless
          there is substantial prior knowledge about the mechanisms
          that generated the data. The idea can be made more precise
          in several ways. There are few successful applications of
          graphical models, mainly because few causal pathways can be

  abstract  = {In recent years, research has generated important advances
          in theory and applications of skew-elliptical
          distributions. This is an exciting and fast- growing field
          of research that brings together both frequentist and
          Bayesian statisticians. Along with an explosion of interest
          in this new area of research has come a virtually unlimited
          potential for applications. This book reviews the
          state-of-the-art advances in skew-elliptical distributions
          and provides many new developments in a single volume,
          collecting theoretical results and applications previously
          scattered throughout the literature. The main goal of this
          research area is to develop flexible parametric classes of
          distributions beyond the classical normal distribution. The
          book is divided into two parts. The first part discusses
          theory and inference for skew- elliptical distribution. The
          second part presents applications and case studies in areas
          such as biostatistics, finance, oceanography, environmental
          science, and engineering. Each chapter is authored by
          leading specialists in key areas of research. With a fine
          balance between theory and application, this book is
          intended for a large readership, including statisticians
          and practitioners from other fields. With exceptional
          cohesion for a contributed work, Skew-Elliptical
          Distributions and Their Applications offers a unique
          opportunity to explore this exciting new field, understand
          its most recent advances, and apply them to your own area

          recent years for solving small-area estimation problems.
          Particularly effective in this regard has been the
          hierarchical or empirical Bayes approach, which is
          especially suitable for a systematic connection of local
          areas through models. However, the development to date has
          mainly concentrated on continuous-valued variates. Often
          the survey data are discrete or categorical, so that
          hierarchical or empirical Bayes techniques designed for
          continuous variates are inappropriate. This article
          considers hierarchical Bayes generalized linear models for
          a unified analysis of both discrete and continuous data. A
          general theorem is provided that ensures the propriety of
          posteriors under diffuse priors. This result is then
          extended to the case of spatial generalized linear models.
          The hierarchical Bayes procedure is implemented via Markov
          chain Monte Carlo integration techniques. Two examples (one
          featuring spatial correlation structure) are given to
          illustrate the general method.}

          sampling due to a growing demand for reliable small area
          statistics from both public and private sectors. It is now
          widely recognized that direct survey estimates for small
          areas are likely to yield unacceptably large standard
          errors due to the smallness of sample sizes in the areas.
          This makes it necessary to "borrow strength" from related
          areas to find more accurate estimates for a given area or,
          simultaneously, for several areas. This has led to the
          development of alternative methods such as synthetic,
          sample size dependent, empirical best linear unbiased
          prediction, empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes
          estimation. The present article is largely an appraisal of
          some of these methods. The performance of these methods is
          also evaluated using some synthetic data resembling a
          business population. Empirical best linear unbiased
          prediction as well as empirical and hierarchical Bayes, for
          most purposes, seem to have a distinct advantage over other

  abstract  = {The results of misspecification tests, based on Rao's
          score principle, are now routinely reported in applied
          econometric work. This paper draws together some important
          recent results which are designed to improve: (a) the
          robustness of standard score tests; and (b) the reliability
          of the asymptotic approximations used for inferential
          purposes. The discussion of robustness includes (i)
          parametric, (ii) distributional, and (iii) higher-order
          moment robustness. The issue of finite sample reliability
          focuses on controlling the size of the score test using (i)
          different variance estimators in conjunction with standard
          asymptotic theory, (ii) finite sample corrections
          obtainable from higher-order asymptotic analysis, and (iii)
          bootstrap procedures.},

  title     = {Testing against a high dimensional alternative},
  abstract  = {As the dimensionality of the alternative hypothesis
          increases, the power of classical tests tends to diminish
          quite rapidly. This is especially true for high dimensional
          data in which there are more parameters than observations.
          We discuss a score test on a hyperparameter in an empirical
          Bayesian model as an alternative to classical tests. It
          gives a general test statistic which can be used to test a
          point null hypothesis against a high dimensional
          alternative, even when the number of parameters exceeds the
          number of samples. This test will be shown to have optimal
          power on average in a neighbourhood of the null hypothesis,
          which makes it a proper generalization of the locally most
          powerful test to multiple dimensions. To illustrate this
          new locally most powerful test we investigate the case of
          testing the global null hypothesis in a linear regression
          model in more detail. The score test is shown to have
          significantly more power than the F-test whenever under the
          alternative the large variance principal components of the
          design matrix explain substantially more of the variance of
          the outcome than do the small variance principal
          components. The score test is also useful for detecting
          sparse alternatives in truly high dimensional data, where
          its power is comparable with the test based on the maximum
          absolute t-statistic.},

        {Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods have facilitated an
        explosion of interest in Bayesian methods. {MCMC} is an incredibly
        useful and important tool but can face difficulties when used to
        estimate complex posteriors or models applied to large data sets. In
        this paper, we show how a recently developed tool in computer science
        for fitting Bayesian models, variational approximations, can be used
        to facilitate the application of Bayesian models to political science
        data. Variational approximations are often much faster than {MCMC}
        for fully Bayesian inference and in some instances facilitate the
        estimation of models that would be otherwise impossible to estimate.
        As a deterministic posterior approximation method, variational
        approximations are guaranteed to converge and convergence is easily
        assessed. But variational approximations do have some limitations,
        which we detail below. Therefore, variational approximations are best
        suited to problems when fully Bayesian inference would otherwise be
        impossible. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate how
        variational approximations are useful for a variety of political
        science research. This includes models to describe legislative voting
        blocs and statistical models for political texts. The code that
        implements the models in this paper is available in the supplementary

        {Many surveys of the {U.S}. household population are experiencing
        higher refusal rates. Nonresponse can, but need not, induce
        nonresponse bias in survey estimates. Recent empirical findings
        illustrate cases when the linkage between nonresponse rates and
        nonresponse biases is absent. Despite this, professional standards
        continue to urge high response rates. Statistical expressions of
        nonresponse bias can be translated into causal models to guide
        hypotheses about when nonresponse causes bias. Alternative designs to
        measure nonresponse bias exist, providing different but incomplete
        information about the nature of the bias. A synthesis of research
        studies estimating nonresponse bias shows the bias often present. A
        logical question at this moment in history is what advantage
        probability sample surveys have if they suffer from high nonresponse
        rates. Since postsurvey adjustment for nonresponse requires auxiliary
        variables, the answer depends on the nature of the design and the
        quality of the auxiliary variables.},

        {? Total survey error? is a conceptual framework describing
        statistical error properties of sample survey statistics. Early in
        the history of sample surveys, it arose as a tool to focus on
        implications of various gaps between the conditions under which
        probability samples yielded unbiased estimates of finite population
        parameters and practical situations in implementing survey design.
        While the framework permits design-based estimates of various error
        components, many of the design burdens to produce those estimates are
        large, and in practice most surveys do not implement them. Further,
        the framework does not incorporate other, nonstatistical, dimensions
        of quality that are commonly utilized in evaluating statistical
        information. The importation of new modeling tools brings new promise
        to measuring total survey error components, but also new challenges.
        A lasting value of the total survey error framework is at the design
        stage of a survey, to attempt a balance of costs and various errors.
        Indeed, this framework is the central organizing structure of the
        field of survey methodology.},

  abstract  = {Comprehensive Monte Carlo evidence is provided that
          compares the finite sample properties of generalized
          empirical likelihood (GEL) estimators to the ones of
          <i>k</i>-class estimators in the linear instrumental
          variables (IV) model. We focus on sample median, mean, mean
          squared error, and on the coverage probability and length
          of confidence intervals obtained from inverting a
          t-statistic based on the various estimators. The results
          indicate that in terms of the above criteria, all the GEL
          estimators and the limited information maximum likelihood
          (LIML) estimator behave very similarly. This suggests that
          GEL estimators might also share the T?no-momentT? problem
          of LIML. At sample sizes as in our Monte Carlo study, there
          is no systematic bias advantage of GEL estimators over
          <i>k</i>-class estimators. On the other hand, the standard
          deviation of GEL estimators is pronouncedly higher than for
          some of the <i>k</i>-class estimators. Therefore, if mean
          squared error is used as the underlying loss function, our
          study suggests the use of computationally simple
          estimators, such as two-stage least squares, in the linear
          IV model rather than GEL. Based on the properties of
          confidence intervals, we cannot recommend the use of GEL
          estimators either in the linear IV model.},

          Dropouts},
  abstract  = {Pattern-mixture models are frequently used for
          longitudinal data analysis with dropouts because they do
          not require explicit specification of the dropout
          mechanism. These models stratify the data according to time
          to dropout and formulate a model for each stratum. This
          usually results in underindentifiability, because we need
          to estimate many pattern-specific parameters even though
          the eventual interest is usually on the marginal
          parameters. In this article we extend this framework to a
          random pattern-mixture model, where the pattern-specific
          parameters are treated as nuisance parameters and modeled
          as random instead of fixed. The pattern is defined
          according to a surrogate for the dropout process. A
          constraint is then put on the pattern by linking it to the
          time to dropout using a random-effects survival model. We
          assume, conditional on the latent pattern effects, that the
          longitudinal outcome and the dropout process are
          independent. This model retains the robustness of the
          traditional pattern-mixture models, while avoiding the
          overparameterization problem. When we define each subject
          as a separate stratum, this model reduces to the shared
          parameter model. Maximum likelihood estimates are obtained
          using an EM Newton– Raphson algorithm. We apply the
          method to the depression data from the Prevention of
          Suicide in Primary Care Elderly Collaborative Trial
          (PROSPECT). We show when the dropout information is
          adjusted for under the proposed model, the treatment seems
          to reduce depression in the elderly.},

          reduces dimension to a finite level, and points to the most
          significant components of the data. However, although this
          technique is often discussed, its properties are not as
          well understood as they might be. We show how the
          properties of functional principal component analysis can
          be elucidated through stochastic expansions and related
          results. Our approach quantifies the errors that arise
          through statistical approximation, in successive terms of
          orders \$n^{-1/2}\$, \$n^{-1}\$, \$n^{-3/2}\$, …, where n
          denotes sample size. The expansions show how spacings among
          eigenvalues impact on statistical performance. The term of
          size \$n^{-1/2}\$ illustrates first-order properties and
          leads directly to limit theory which describes the dominant
          effect of spacings. Thus, for example, spacings are seen to
          have an immediate, first-order effect on properties of
          eigenfunction estimators, but only a second-order effect on
          eigenvalue estimators. Our results can be used to explore
          properties of existing methods, and also to suggest new

          generalized-method-of-moments estimators often have true
          levels that differ greatly from their nominal levels when
          asymptotic critical values are used. This paper gives
          conditions under which the bootstrap provides asymptotic
          refinements to the critical values of t tests and the test
          of overidentifying restrictions. Particular attention is
          given to the case of dependent data. It is shown that with
          such data, the bootstrap must sample blocks of data and
          that the formulae for the bootstrap versions of test
          statistics differ from the formulae that apply with the
          original data. The results of Monte Carlo experiments on
          the numerical performance of the bootstrap show that it
          usually reduces the errors in level that occur when
          critical values based on first-order asymptotic theory are
          used. The bootstrap also provides an indication of the
          accuracy of critical values obtained from first-order
          asymptotic theory.}

          and entropy-based moment selection},
  abstract  = {In this paper, we make five contributions to the
          literature on information and entropy in generalized method
          of moments (GMM) estimation. First, we introduce the
          concept of the long run canonical correlations (LRCCs)
          between the true score vector and the moment function
          f(vt,[theta]0) and show that they provide a metric for the
          information contained in the population moment condition
          E[f(vt,[theta]0)]=0. Second, we show that the entropy of
          the limiting distribution of the GMM estimator can be
          written in terms of these LRCCs. Third, motivated by the
          above results, we introduce an information criterion based
          on this entropy that can be used as a basis for moment
          selection. Fourth, we introduce the concept of nearly
          redundant moment conditions and use it to explore the
          connection between redundancy and weak identification.
          Fifth, we analyse the behaviour of the aforementioned
          entropy-based moment selection method in two scenarios of
          interest; these scenarios are: (i) nonlinear dynamic models
          where the parameter vector is identified by all the
          combinations of moment conditions considered; (ii) linear
          static models where the parameter vector may be weakly
          identified for some of the combinations considered. The
          first of these contributions rests on a generalized
          information equality that is proved in the paper, and may
          be of interest in its own right.},

          standard test statistics are described as functionals of
          chi-square processes. In general, the distributions depend
          upon a large number of unknown parameters. We show that a
          transformation based upon a conditional probability measure
          yields an asymptotic distribution free of nuisance
          parameters, and we show that this transformation can be
          easily approximated via simulation. The theory is applied
          to threshold models, with special attention given to the
          so-called self-exciting threshold autoregressive model.
          Monte Carlo methods are used to assess the finite sample
          distributions. The tests are applied to U.S. GNP growth
          rates, and we find that Potter's (1995) threshold effect in
          this series can be possibly explained by sampling
          variation.}

        Recent developments promise to increase greatly the popularity of
        maximum likelihood (ml) as a technique for estimating variance
        components. Patterson and Thompson (1971) proposed a restricted
        maximum likelihood (reml) approach which takes into account the loss
        in degrees of freedom resulting from estimating fixed effects. Miller
        (1973) developed a satisfactory asymptotic theory for ml estimators
        of variance components. There are many iterative algorithms that can
        be considered for computing the ml or reml estimates. The
        computations on each iteration of these algorithms are those
        associated with computing estimates of fixed and random effects for
        given values of the variance components.},

          current SAS macro provides a straightforward method for
          researchers to use the vanishing tetrads implied by models

  abstract  = {Since Wu and Carroll (Biometrics 44, 175-188) proposed a
          model for longitudinal progression in the presence of
          informative dropout, several researchers have developed and
          studied models for situations where both a vector of
          repeated outcomes and an event time is available for each
          subject. These models have been developed for either
          longitudinal studies with dropout or for survival studies
          in which a random, time-varying covariate is measured
          repeatedly across time. When inference about the
          longitudinal variable is of interest, event times are
          treated as covariates and are often incomplete due to
          censoring. If survival or event time is the primary
          endpoint, repeated outcomes observed prior to the event are
          viewed as covariates; this covariate process is often
          incomplete, measured with error, or observed at unscheduled
          times during the study. We review several models which are
          used to handle incomplete response and covariate data in
          both survival and longitudinal studies. {\copyright} 1997

        {Behavior coding is one technique researchers use to detect problems
        in survey questions, but it has been primarily explored as a
        practical tool rather than a source of insight into the theoretical
        understanding of the cognitive processes by which respondents answer
        survey questions. The latter is the focus of the current
        investigation. Using data from a large study in which face-to-face
        interviews were taped and extensive behavior coding was done, we
        tested whether sets of respondent behavior codes could be used to
        distinguish respondent difficulties with comprehension of the
        question from difficulties associated with mapping a judgment onto
        the response format provided, and whether characteristics of the
        survey questions and respondents could be used to predict when and
        for whom such difficulties would occur. Sets of behavior codes were
        identified that reflected comprehension and mapping difficulties, and
        these two types of difficulties were associated with different
        question and respondent characteristics. This evidence suggests that
        behavior coding shows promise as a tool for researchers studying the
        cognitive processes involved in answering survey questions.},

          mean is uniformly best in all situations but empirical

          an important unifying framework for inference in

          encompassing almost all of the common estimation methods,
          such as maximum likelihood, ordinary least squares,
          instrumental variables, and two-stage least squares, and
          nowadays is an important part of all advanced econometrics
          textbooks. The GMM approach links nicely to economic theory
          where orthogonality conditions that can serve as such
          moment functions often arise from optimizing behavior of
          agents. Much work has been done on these methods since the
          seminal article by Hansen, and much remains in progress.
          This article discusses some of the developments since
          Hansen\&\#039;s original work. In particular, it focuses on
          some of the recent work on empirical likelihood\&\#150;type
          estimators, which circumvent the need for a first step in
          which the optimal weight matrix is estimated and have

          order (M-1)^2/N. Consequently GEL must be expected to
          dominate 2-step GMM. In our simple model all GEL's have
          equivalent next higher order behavior because generalized
          third moments of moment conditions are assumed to be zero;
          we explore, in further analysis and simulations, the
          implications of dropping this assumption.},

          method for estimating standard errors in covariance
          structure analysis. Beyond its simplicity and generality
          what makes the infinitesimal jackknife method attractive is
          that essentially no assumptions are required to produce
          consistent standard error estimates, not even the
          requirement that the population sampled has the covariance
          structure assumed. Commonly used covariance structure
          analysis software uses parametric methods for estimating
          parameters and standard errors. When the population sampled
          has the covariance structure assumed, but fails to have the
          distributional form assumed, the parameter estimates
          usually remain consistent, but the standard error estimates
          do not. This has motivated the introduction of a variety of
          nonparametric standard error estimates that are consistent
          when the population sampled fails to have the
          distributional form assumed. The only distributional
          assumption these require is that the covariance structure
          be correctly specified. As noted, even this assumption is
          not required for the infinitesimal jackknife. The relation
          between the infinitesimal jackknife and other nonparametric
          standard error estimators is discussed. An advantage of the
          infinitesimal jackknife over the jackknife and the
          bootstrap is that it requires only one analysis to produce
          standard error estimates rather than one for every
          jackknife or bootstrap sample.}

          value of an n ? p matrix X, all of whose entries are
          independent standard Gaussian variates. Equivalently,
          \$x\_{(1)}\$ is the largest principal component variance of
          the covariance matrix \$X'X\$, or the largest eigenvalue of
          a p-variate Wishart distribution on n degrees of freedom
          with identity covariance.

          Consider the limit of large p and n with \$n/p = \gamma \ge
          1\$. When centered by \$\mu\_p = (\sqrt{n-1} +
          \sqrt{p})^2\$ and scaled by \$\sigma\_p = (\sqrt{n-1} +
          \sqrt{p})(1/\sqrt{n-1} + 1/\sqrt{p}^{1/3}\$, the
          distribution of x(1) approaches the Tracey-Widom law of
          order 1, which is defined in terms of the Painlev\'{e} II
          differential equation and can be numerically evaluated and
          tabulated in software. Simulations show the approximation
          to be informative for n and p as small as 5.

          The limit is derived via a corresponding result for complex
          Wishart matrices using methods from random matrix theory.
          The result suggests that some aspects of large p
          multivariate distribution theory may be easier to apply in
          practice than their fixed p counterparts.},

  abstract  = {This paper considers health-related non-response in the
          first eleven waves of the British Household Panel Survey
          (BHPS) and the full eight waves of the European Community
          Household Panel (ECHP) and explores its consequences for
          dynamic models of the association between socioeconomic
          status and self-assessed health (SAH). To address this
          issue we describe the pattern of health-related
          non-response revealed by the BHPS and ECHP data. We both
          test and correct for non-response in empirical models of
          the impact of socioeconomic status on self-assessed health.
          Descriptive evidence shows that there is health-related
          non-response in the data, with those in very poor initial
          health more likely to drop out, and variable addition tests
          provide evidence of non-response bias in the panel data
          models of SAH. Nevertheless a comparison of estimates -
          based on the balanced sample, the unbalanced sample and
          corrected for non-response using inverse probability
          weights (IPW) – shows that, on the whole, there are not
          substantive differences in the average partial effects
          (APE) of the variables of interest. The main differences
          are between unweighted and IPW-2 weighted estimates for the
          APE of income and education in those countries that have
          fewer than eight waves of data. Similar findings have been

          bias in models of various labour market outcomes; we

  abstract  = {A new computational method for the maximum likelihood
          solution in factor analysis is presented. This method takes
          into account the fact that the likelihood function may not
          have a maximum in a point of the parameter space where all
          unique variances are positive. Instead, the maximum may be
          attained on the boundary of the parameter space where one
          or more of the unique variances are zero. It is
          demonstrated that suchimproper (Heywood) solutions occur
          more often than is usually expected. A general procedure to
          deal with such improper solutions is proposed. The proposed
          methods are illustrated using two small sets of empirical
          data, and results obtained from the analyses of many other
          sets of data are reported. These analyses verify that the
          new computational method converges rapidly and that the
          maximum likelihood solution can be determined very
          accurately. A by-product obtained by the method is a large
          sample estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the
          estimated unique variances. This can be used to set up
          approximate confidence intervals for communalities and
          unique variances.}

  abstract  = {The standard balanced repeated replication (BRR) method of
          estimating variances involves dividing the sample in each
          stratum into half-samples, selecting a balanced set of half
          samples across all strata, re-computing the statistic of
          interest (generally nonlinear) on each selected
          half-sample, and taking the mean square difference of among
          the replicate estimates as the variance estimate. One
          problem that occasionally arises is that one or more
          replicate estimates will be undefined due to division by
          zero. This is particularly common when ratio estimation has
          been used with very small cell sizes. Robert Fay suggested
          a solution to this problem several years ago: Instead of
          increasing the weights of one half sample by $100\%$ and
          decreasing the weights of the other half sample to zero, he
          recommended perturbing the weights by $\pm x\%$. In this
          article, his suggestion is evaluated with simulation
          techniques. It is shown to be useful when variance
          estimates are needed for both smooth and nonsmooth
          statistics or when there are very few degrees of freedom
          available for variance estimation. The paper also discusses
          further modifications to the technique that are useful for
          variance estimation when only one PSU is selected per
          stratum.}

          misspecification on the estimation, testing, and
          improvement of structural equation models. A population
          study is conducted whereby a prototypical latent variable
          model is misspecified in various ways. Measurement model
          and structural model misspecifications are considered
          separately and together. The maximum likelihood estimator
          (ML) is compared to a limited information two-stage least
          squares (2SLS) estimator implemented in LISREL. The ratio
          of chi-square to its degrees of freedom and power of the
          likelihood ratio test is assessed for each
          misspecification. The modification index provided by LISREL
          is also studied. Results indicate that ML and 2SLS
          estimates of measurement and structural parameters are both
          affected by measurement model misspecification. For
          misspecification of the structural part, ML is shown to
          propagate errors throughout the structural parameters
          whereas 2SLS isolates errors only in the parameters of the
          misspecified equation. Results also show that relying on
          the ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom as an index
          of fit may lead to accepting models with severe parameter
          bias. Finally, the modification index is shown to be an
          unreliable indicator of the location of a specification
          error.},

        {It is routine practice for survey organizations to provide
        replication weights as part of survey data files. These replication
        weights are meant to produce valid and efficient variance estimates
        for a variety of estimators in a simple and systematic manner. Most
        existing methods for constructing replication weights, however, are
        only valid for specific sampling designs and typically require a very
        large number of replicates. In this paper we first show how to
        produce replication weights based on the method outlined in Fay
        (1984) such that the resulting replication variance estimator is
        algebraically equivalent to the fully efficient linearization
        variance estimator for any given sampling design. We then propose a
        novel weight-calibration method to simultaneously achieve efficiency
        and sparsity in the sense that a small number of sets of replication
        weights can produce valid and efficient replication variance
        estimators for key population parameters. Our proposed method can be
        used in conjunction with existing resampling techniques for
        large-scale complex surveys. Validity of the proposed methods and
        extensions to some balanced sampling designs are also discussed.
        Simulation results showed that our proposed variance estimators
        perform very well in tracking coverage probabilities of confidence
        intervals. Our proposed strategies will likely have impact on how
        public-use survey data files are produced and how these data sets are

          is a powerful tool for social and behavioral scientists,

          econometrics into a single framework. The most common
          estimator for SEM is the full-information maximum
          likelihood (ML) estimator, but there is continuing interest
          in limited information estimators because of their
          distributional robustness and their greater resistance to
          structural specification errors. However, the literature
          discussing model fit for limited information estimators for
          latent variable models is sparse compared with that for
          full-information estimators. We address this shortcoming by
          providing several specification tests based on the 2SLS
          estimator for latent variable structural equation models
          developed by Bollen (1996). We explain how these tests can
          be used not only to identify a misspecified model but to
          help diagnose the source of misspecification within a
          model. We present and discuss results from a Monte Carlo
          experiment designed to evaluate the finite sample
          properties of these tests. Our findings suggest that the
          2SLS tests successfully identify most misspecified models,
          even those with modest misspecification, and that they
          provide researchers with information that can help diagnose
          the source of misspecification.}

          smoothing method, we efficiently incorporate the
          information implied by the conditional moment restrictions
          into our empirical likelihood-based procedure. This yields
          a one-step estimator which avoids estimating optimal
          instruments. Our likelihood ratio-type statistic for
          parametric restrictions does not require the estimation of
          variance, and achieves asymptotic pivotalness implicitly.
          The estimation and testing procedures we propose are
          normalization invariant. Simulation results suggest that
          our new estimator works remarkably well in finite

       {Routine applications of quantile regression analysis require
       reliable and practical algorithms for estimating standard

       estimator depends on error densities, some standard
       large-sample approximations have been found to be highly
       sensitive to minor deviations from the iid error assumption.

       marginal bootstrap (MCMB) to construct confidence intervals
       in quantile regression. This method is compared to several

  abstract  = {This dissertation outlines the use of the maximum
          likelihood procedures for estimation of the parameters of
          spatial and spatio-temporal processes when some
          observations are missing, and reviews the realizations of
          ML and EM procedures in the presence of missing data when
          the data are correlated. A version of the EM algorithm is
          suggested that has a promise of being computationally more
          efficient due to reduction of the number of matrix
          inversions, although at a price of the loss of the
          estimator's consistency and asymptotic efficiency.
          Corrections that restore unbiasedness of the estimating
          equations implied by the EM algorithm are proposed.
          Asymptotic properties (consistency and normality) of the
          resulting estimators are established. Applications of the
          new procedure are considered: an analytically tractable
          case of AR(1) process, and an application to real data on
          PM$_{2.5}$ measurements.}

          Sampling Design},
  abstract  = {Large scale health surveys offer an opportunity to study
          associations between risk factors and outcomes in a
          population-based setting. Their complicated multistage
          sampling designs with differential probabilities of
          sampling individuals can make their analysis
          unstraightforward. Classical 'design-based' methods that
          yield approximately unbiased estimators of associations and
          standard errors can be highly inefficient. Model-based
          methods require assumptions which, if wrong, can lead to
          biased estimators of associations and standard errors. This
          paper examines the implications of utilizing the sample
          clustering and sample weights in the analysis of survey
          data. The approach is to estimate the inefficiency of using
          these aspects of the sampling design in a design-based
          analysis when actually it was unnecessary to do so. If the
          inefficiency is small, then that aspect of the design is
          used in a design-based fashion. Otherwise, additional
          modelling assumptions are incorporated into the analysis.
          By focusing attention on risk factor-outcome associations
          in large health surveys, specific recommendations for
          practitioners are given. The issues are demonstrated with
          real survey data including two controversial analyses
          previously published in medical references.},

        {Although it is well established that self-administered
        questionnaires tend to yield fewer reports in the socially desirable
        direction than do interviewer-administered questionnaires, less is
        known about whether different modes of self-administration vary in
        their effects on socially desirable responding. In addition, most
        mode comparison studies lack validation data and thus cannot separate
        the effects of differential nonresponse bias from the effects of
        differences in measurement error. This paper uses survey and record
        data to examine mode effects on the reporting of potentially
        sensitive information by a sample of recent university graduates.
        Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three modes of data
        collection?conventional computer-assisted telephone interviewing
        ({CATI}), interactive voice recognition ({IVR}), and the Web?and were
        asked about both desirable and undesirable attributes of their
        academic experiences. University records were used to evaluate the
        accuracy of the answers and to examine differences in nonresponse
        bias by mode. Web administration increased the level of reporting of
        sensitive information and reporting accuracy relative to conventional
        {CATI}, with {IVR} intermediate between the other two modes. Both
        mode of data collection and the actual status of the respondent
        influenced whether respondents found an item sensitive.},

  abstract  = {{There's a "Frank \& Ernest" comic strip showing a chick
          breaking out of its shell, looking around, and saying, "Oh,
          wow! Paradigm shift!" Blame the late Thomas Kuhn. Few
          indeed are the philosophers or historians influential
          enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is
          one.<p> <I>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</I> is
          indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science.
          Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal
          science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain
          through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on
          social and psychological factors in science--all have had
          profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers,
          critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist
          in the street.<p> Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg
          and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn,
          especially by the doubts he casts--or the way his work has
          been used to cast doubt--on the idea of scientific
          progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate
          tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by
          geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm
          shift. Even Weinberg has said that "<I>Structure</I> has
          had a wider influence than any other book on the history of
          science." As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, "We all live

  abstract  = {This paper offers the data analyst a range of practical
          procedures for dealing with outliers in multilevel data. It
          first develops several techniques for data exploration for
          outliers and outlier analysis and then applies these to the
          detailed analysis of outliers in two large scale multilevel
          data sets from educational contexts. The techniques include
          the use of deviance reduction, measures based on residuals,
          leverage values, hierarchical cluster analysis and a
          measure called DFITS. Outlier analysis is more complex in a
          multilevel data set than in, say, a univariate sample or a
          set of regression data, where the concept of an outlying
          value is straightforward. In the multilevel situation one
          has to consider, for example, at what level or levels a
          particular response is outlying, and in respect of which
          explanatory variables; furthermore, the treatment of a
          particular response at one level may affect its status or
          the status of other units at other levels in the model.},

  abstract  = {Empirical likelihood was introduced as a nonparametric
          analogue of ordinary parametric likelihood. It is well
          known that the empirical likelihood ratio statistic
          inherits a number of properties of the parametric
          likelihood ratio statistic, such as the aymptotic
          chi-squared distribution and Bartlett correctability. This
          raises the question of whether or not the same is true in
          the presence of nuisance parameters. Recent work by Qin
          Lawless (1994) indicates that the chi-squared distribution
          is still valid to first order. We show that, when nuisance
          parameters are present, as introduced via a system of
          estimating equations, the asymptotic expansion for the
          signed square root of the empirical likelihood ratio
          statistic has a nonstandard form. This implies that the
          empirical likelihood ratio statistic itself does not permit
          a Bartlett correction. Keywords:Accuracy; Bartlett
          correction; Edgeworth expansion; Empirical likelihood;

          modified. The generalized score, the likelihood ratio and
          the modified Wald tests are shown to be asymptotically
          equivalent. The asymptotic efficiency of the tests is
          derived.}

          through the replacement of residual correlations with
          direct paths, or through the inversion of path directions.

          These include the Gauss-Newton, Newton-Raphson, Fisher
          Scoring, and Fletcher-Reeves algorithms. Two methods of
          estimation are considered, maximum likelihood and weighted
          least squares. It is shown that the Gauss-Newton algorithm
          which in standard form produces weighted least squares
          estimates can, in iteratively reweighted form, produce
          maximum likelihood estimates as well. Previously
          unavailable standard error estimates to be used in
          conjunction with the Fletcher-Reeves algorithm are derived.
          Finally all the algorithms are applied to a number of
          maximum likelihood and weighted least squares factor
          analysis problems to compare the estimates and the standard
          errors produced. The algorithms appear to give satisfactory
          estimates but there are serious discrepancies in the
          standard errors. Because it is robust to poor starting
          values, converges rapidly and conveniently produces
          consistent standard errors for both maximum likelihood and
          weighted least squares problems, the Gauss-Newton algorithm
          represents an attractive alternative for at least some
          covariance structure analyses.}

             inferences as rigorous as possible given the non-experimental

             about incorporating the survey design with the propensity score

             treatment effect, as long as good population treated-comparison
             balance is achieved on confounders, (ii) survey weights must be
             used in the outcome analysis, and (iii) the transferring of survey
             weights (i.e., assigning the weights of the treated units to the
             comparison units matched to them) can be beneficial under certain

     are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a

     presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases

     correlation structures from each subject are discussed.
     Efficiency of the pioposecl estimators in two simple situations
     is considered. The approach is closely related to

  title     = {Modeling the Drop-Out Mechanism in Repeated-Measures
          Studies},
  abstract  = {Subjects often drop out of longitudinal studies
          prematurely, yielding unbalanced data with unequal numbers
          of measures for each subject. Modern software programs for
          handling unbalanced longitudinal data improve on methods
          that discard the incomplete cases by including all the
          data, but also yield biased inferences under plausible
          models for the drop-out process. This article discusses
          methods that simultaneously model the data and the drop-out
          process within a unified model-based framework. Models are
          classified into two broad classes--random-coefficient
          selection models and random-coefficient pattern-mixture
          models--depending on how the joint distribution of the data
          and drop-out mechanism is factored. Inference is
          likelihood-based, via maximum likelihood or Bayesian
          methods. A number of examples in the literature are placed
          in this framework, and possible extensions outlined. Data
          collection on the nature of the drop-out process is
          advocated to guide the choice of model. In cases where the
          drop-out mechanism is not well understood, sensitivity
          analyses are suggested to assess the effect on inferences
          about target quantities of alternative assumptions about
          the drop-out process.},

        {A basic estimation strategy in sample surveys is to weight units
        inversely proportional to the probability of selection and response.
        Response weights in this method are usually estimated by the inverse
        of the sample-weighted response rate in an adjustment cell, that is,
        the ratio of the sum of the sampling weights of respondents in a cell
        to the sum of the sampling weights for respondents and
        non-respondents in that cell. We show by simulations that weighting
        the response rates by the sampling weights to adjust for design
        variables is either incorrect or unnecessary. It is incorrect, in the
        sense of yielding biased estimates of population quantities, if the
        design variables are related to survey non-response; it is
        unnecessary if the design variables are unrelated to survey
        non-response. The correct approach is to model non-response as a
        function of the adjustment cell and design variables, and to estimate
        the response weight as the inverse of the estimated response
        probability from this model. This approach can be implemented by
        creating adjustment cells that include design variables in the
        cross-classification, if the number of cells created in this way is
        not too large. Otherwise, response propensity weighting can be
        applied.},

  abstract  = {{A large number of scientists and engineers employ Monte
          Carlo simulation and related global optimization techniques
          (such as simulated annealing) as an essential tool in their
          work. For such scientists, there is a need to keep up to
          date with several recent advances in Monte Carlo
          methodologies such as cluster methods, data- augmentation,
          simulated tempering and other auxiliary variable methods.
          There is also a trend in moving towards a population-based
          approach. All these advances in one way or another were
          motivated by the need to sample from very complex
          distribution for which traditional methods would tend to be
          trapped in local energy minima. It is our aim to provide a
          self-contained and up to date treatment of the Monte Carlo
          method to this audience. The Monte Carlo method is a
          computer-based statistical sampling approach for solving
          numerical problems concerned with a complex system. The
          methodology was initially developed in the field of
          statistical physics during the early days of electronic
          computing (1945-55) and has now been adopted by researchers
          in almost all scientific fields. The fundamental idea for
          constructing Markov chain based Monte Carlo algorithms was
          introduced in the 1950s. This idea was later extended to
          handle more and more complex physical systems. In the
          1980s, statisticians and computer scientists developed
          Monter Carlo-based algorithms for a wide variety of
          integration and optimization tasks. In the 1990s, the
          method began to play an important role in computational
          biology. Over the past fifty years, reasearchers in diverse
          scientific fields have studied the Monte Carlo method and
          contributed to its development. Today, a large number of
          scientisits and engineers employ Monte Carlo techniques as
          an essential tool in their work. For such scientists, there
          is a need to keep up-to-date with recent advances in Monte
          Carlo methodologies.}},

          treatment may be suboptimal and may yield poor performance,
          such as for support vector machines (SVMs). We propose a
          novel multicategory generalization of -learning that treats
          all classes simultaneously. The new generalization
          eliminates this potential problem while at the same time
          retaining the desirable properties of its binary
          counterpart. We develop a statistical learning theory for
          the proposed methodology and obtain fast convergence rates

          of Hinkley (1977) and White (1980). On the basis of
          sampling experiments which compare the performance of quasi
          t-statistics, we find that one estimator, based on the
          jackknife, performs better in small samples than the rest.
          We also examine the finite-sample properties of using
          modified critical values based on Edgeworth approximations,
          as proposed by Rothenberg (1984). In addition, we compare
          the power of several tests for heteroskedasticity, and find
          that it may be wise to employ the jackknife
          heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix even in the
          absence of detected heteroskedasticity.}

          up to an affine transformation. This paper deals with the
          robust estimation of the location vector $\mathbf{t}$ and
          scatter matrix $\mathbf{V}$ by means of "$M$-estimators,"
          defined as solutions of the system: $\sum_i
          u_1(d_i)(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{t}) = \mathbf{0}$ and
          $n^{-1}\sum_i u_2(d_i^2)(\mathbf{x}_i -
          \mathbf{t})(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{t})' = \mathbf{V}$,
          where $d_i^2 = (\mathbf{x}_i -
          \mathbf{t})'\mathbf{V}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{t})$.
          Existence and uniqueness of solutions of this system are
          proved under general assumptions about the functions $u_1$
          and $u_2$. Then the estimators are shown to be consistent
          and asymptotically normal. The breakdown bound and the
          influence function are calculated, showing some weaknesses
          of the estimates for high dimensionality. An algorithm for
          the numerical calculation of the estimators is described.
          Finally, numerical values of asymptotic variances, and
          Monte Carlo small-sample results are exhibited.},

          at Harvard University, Andreu Mas-Colell, Michael Whinston,
          and Jerry Green have filled that conspicuous vacancy with
          their groundbreaking text, Microeconomic Theory. <P>The
          authors set out to create a solid organizational foundation
          upon which to build the effective teaching tool for
          microeconomic theory. The result presents unprecedented
          depth of coverage in all the essential topics, while
          allowing professors to "tailor-make" their course to suit
          personal priorities and style. Topics such as
          noncooperative game theory, information economics,
          mechanism design, and general equilibrium under uncertainty
          receive the attention that reflects their stature within
          the discipline. The authors devote an entire section to
          game theory alone, making it "free-standing" to allow
          instructors to return to it throughout the course when
          convenient. Discussion is clear, accessible, and engaging,
          enabling the student to gradually acquire confidence as
          well as proficiency. Extensive exercises within each

          text's appendix of terms, fully cross-referenced throughout
          the previous five sections, offers an accessible guide to
          the subject matter's terminology. Teachers of
          microeconomics need no longer rely upon scattered lecture
          notes to supplement their textbooks. Deftly written by
          three of the field's most influential scholars,

          matrices for these variables. Data on the observed
          variables is then computed from latent and error variables
          according to the model. It is shown that by controlling
          univariate skewness and kurtosis on pre-specified random
          latent and error variables, observed variables can be made
          to have a relatively wide range of univariate skewness and
          kurtosis characteristics according to the pre-specified
          model. Univariate distributions are used for the generation
          of data which enables a user to choose from a large number

          procedure is illustrated for two different structural

          the available data, fitting a prediction function to the
          portion remaining, and then testing the fitted function on
          the omitted data. Ideally, one would like to repeat this
          process on all possible splits. In many instances, this is
          not computationally feasible. This paper argues and
          demonstrates, using half samples by way of illustration,
          that the balanced sampling techniques developed for the
          analysis of complex sample survey data provide an efficient
          way of sampling the population of all possible splits.}

          is exchangeable, the choice of monoid is not unique.

       important for structural equation models, but only recently
       has it become possible to estimate the power associated with
       the test of an entire model. This article discusses the
       relevance of power for structural equation models and
       measurement validation, then examines the question of the
       degree of power associated with models published in business
       journals. Addressing this matter is essential, because
       statistical power directly affects the confidence with which
       test results can be interpreted. The issue is particularly
       appropriate in light of the increased use of structural
       equation models in business research. Using articles from
       some leading business journals as examples, a survey finds
       that power tends to be either very low, implying that too
       many false models will not be rejected (Type II error), or
       extremely high, causing overrejection of tenable models (Type
       I error). The implications of this discovery are explored,
       and recommendations that should improve the validity and

      {Many in the survey research community have expressed concern at the
      growing popularity of nonprobability surveys. The absence of random
      selection prompts justified concerns about self-selection producing
      biased results and means that traditional, design-based estimation is
      inappropriate. This paper seeks to provide insight into the conditions
      under which nonprobability surveys can be expected to provide estimates
      free of selection bias. In fields such as epidemiology and economics that
      routinely work with observational data, researchers have identified the
      necessary conditions for unbiased estimation of causal effects when
      treatments are not assigned randomly. Similar conditions apply to survey
      estimates when respondents are not randomly selected. Drawing on this
      body of research, we propose a framework composed of three elements that
      determine the level of selection bias in survey estimates. In this paper,
      we first provide a general overview of these components and demonstrate
      the link between causal inference and survey inference in the
      probability-based setting. Second, we give simplified examples to
      demonstrate how each of the components can contribute to bias in survey
      estimates. Finally, we review current practices in the area of
      nonprobability data collection and estimation, and specify how these
      methods relate to the elements identified here.},

        {Factor analysis for nonnormally distributed variables is
        discussed in this paper. The main difference between our
        approach and more traditional approaches is that not only
        second order cross-products (like covariances) are utilized,
        but also higher order cross-products. It turns out that
        under some conditions the parameters (factor loadings) can
        be uniquely determined. Two estimation procedures will be
        discussed. One method gives Best Generalized Least Squares
        (BGLS) estimates, but is computationally very heavy, in
        particular for large data sets. The other method is a least
        squares method which is computationally less heavy. In one
        example the two methods will be compared by using the
        bootstrap method. In another example real life data are
        analyzed.},

          models (SEM), the classical chi-square goodness-of-fit test
          is unable to detect the presence of nonlinear terms in the
          model. As an example, we consider a regression model with
          latent variables and interactions terms. Not only the model
          test has zero power against that type of misspecifications,
          but even the theoretical (chi-square) distribution of the
          test is not distorted when severe interaction term
          misspecification is present in the postulated model. We
          explain this phenomenon by exploiting results on asymptotic
          robustness in structural equation models. The importance of
          this paper is to warn against the conclusion that if a
          proposed linear model fits the data well according to the
          chi-quare goodness-of-fit test, then the underlying model
          is linear indeed; it will be shown that the underlying
          model may, in fact, be severely nonlinear. In addition, the
          present paper shows that such insensitivity to nonlinear
          terms is only a particular instance of a more general
          problem, namely, the incapacity of the classical chi-square
          goodness-of-fit test to detect deviations from zero
          correlation among exogenous regressors (either being them
          observable, or latent) when the structural part of the
          model is just saturated.}

          the potential of multilevel factor analysis methodology.
          Issues related to between- and within-class decomposition
          of achievement variance and the change of this
          decomposition over the course of the eighth grade are
          studied. As a starting point, random effects ANOVA is
          considered for each achievement score. Each score contains
          a large amount of measurement error. The effects of
          unreliability on variance decomposition are shown with the
          help of a multilevel factor analysis model. Unreliability
          has severely distorting effects on this type of ANOVA while
          multilevel factor analysis gives results corresponding to
          what would be obtained with perfectly reliable scores.}

  abstract  = {This papers studies and compares the asymptotic bias of
          GMM and generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) estimators
          in the presence of estimated nuisance parameters. We
          consider cases in which the nuisance parameter is estimated
          from independent and identical samples. A simulation
          experiment is conducted for covariance structure models.
          Empirical likelihood offers much reduced mean and median
          bias, root mean squared error and mean absolute error, as
          compared with two-step GMM and other GEL methods. Both
          analytical and bootstrap bias-adjusted two-step GMM
          estimators are compared. Analytical bias-adjustment appears
          to be a serious competitor to bootstrap methods in terms of
          finite sample bias, root mean squared error and mean
          absolute error. Finite sample variance seems to be little
          affected.}

          generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators, a number of
          alternative estimators have been suggested. These include
          empirical likelihood (EL), continuous updating, and
          exponential tilting estimators. We show that these
          estimators share a common structure, being members of a
          class of generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) estimators.
          We use this structure to compare their higher order
          asymptotic properties. We find that GEL has no asymptotic
          bias due to correlation of the moment functions with their
          Jacobian, eliminating an important source of bias for GMM
          in models with endogeneity. We also find that EL has no
          asymptotic bias from estimating the optimal weight matrix,
          eliminating a further important source of bias for GMM in
          panel data models. We give bias corrected GMM and GEL
          estimators. We also show that bias corrected EL inherits
          the higher order property of maximum likelihood, that it is
          higher order asymptotically efficient relative to the other
          bias corrected estimators.}

        variance. It is rare, however, to find studies in which the complex

       without losing statistical power. In this paper, we show how
       study designs can be improved without changing statistical
       power by defining power equivalence, a relation between
       structural equation models (SEMs) that holds true if two SEMs
       have the same power on a likelihood ratio test to detect a
       given effect. We show systematic operations of SEMs that
       maintain power, and give an algorithm that efficiently
       reduces SEMs to power-equivalent models with a minimal number
       of observed parameters. In this way, optimal study designs
       can be found without reducing statistical power. Furthermore,
       the algorithm can be used to drastically increase the speed
       of power computations when using Monte Carlo simulations or
       approximation methods.},

          to obtain confidence regions for vector valued statistical
          functionals. The result is a nonparametric version of
          Wilks' theorem and a multivariate generalization of work by
          Owen. Cornish-Fisher expansions show that the empirical
          likelihood intervals for a one dimensional mean are less
          adversely affected by skewness than are those based on
          Student's t statistic. An effective method is presented for
          computing empirical profile likelihoods for the mean of a
          vector random variable. The method is a reduction by convex
          duality to an unconstrained minimization of a convex
          function on a low dimensional domain. Algorithms exist for
          finding the unique global minimum at a superlinear rate of
          convergence. A byproduct is a noncombinatorial algorithm
          for determining whether a given point lies within the
          convex hull of a finite set of points. The multivariate

          inherent advantages over resampling methods: it uses the
          data to determine the shape of the confidence regions, and
          it makes it easy to combined data from multiple sources. It
          also facilitates incorporating side information, and it
          simplifies accounting for censored, truncated, or biased
          sampling. One of the first books published on the subject,
          Empirical Likelihood offers an in-depth treatment of this
          method for constructing confidence regions and testing
          hypotheses. The author applies empirical likelihood to a
          range of problems, from those as simple as setting a
          confidence region for a univariate mean under IID sampling,
          to problems defined through smooth functions of means,
          regression models, generalized linear models, estimating
          equations, or kernel smooths, and to sampling with
          non-identically distributed data. Abundant figures offer
          visual reinforcement of the concepts and techniques.
          Examples from a variety of disciplines and detailed
          descriptions of algorithms-also posted on a companion Web
          site at- illustrate the methods in practice. Exercises help
          readers to understand and apply the methods. The method of
          empirical likelihood is now attracting serious attention
          from researchers in econometrics and biostatistics, as well
          as from statisticians. This book is your opportunity to
          explore its foundations, its advantages, and its
          application to a myriad of practical problems.}

          is simply the sample standard error applied to certain
          non-randomized quasi-Monte Carlo points. This
          quasi-standard error (QSE) closely tracks the actual error
          in an example, and looks to be at least as accurate as a
          standard error based on random replication. We also show
          that the quasi-standard error is not unreasonably large in
          its intended use. But there are QMC constructions for which
          the QSE severely underestimates the true error. Moreover,
          discrepancy considerations do not separate these
          counterexamples from other cases where the method might be
          reliable. We conclude that the QSE is not yet ready to be
          trusted in applications.}

  abstract  = {High fruit and vegetable intake is associated with
          decreased cancer risk. However, dietary recall data from
          national surveys suggest that, on any given day, intake
          falls below the recommended minima of three daily servings
          of vegetables and two daily servings of fruit. There is no
          single widely accepted measure of \&quot;usual\&quot;
          intake. One approach is to regard the distribution of
          intake as a mixture of \&quot;regular\&quot; (relatively
          frequent) and \&quot;nonregular\&quot; (relatively
          infrequent) consumers, using an indicator of whether an
          individual consumed the food of interest on the recall day.
          We use a new approach to summarizing dietary data, latent
          class analysis (LCA), to estimate \&quot;usual\&quot;
          intake of vegetables. The data consist of four 24-hour
          dietary recalls from the 1985 Continuing Survey of Intakes
          by Individuals collected from 1,028 women. Traditional LCA
          based on simple random sampling was extended to complex
          survey data by introducing sample weights into the latent
          class estimation algorithm and by accounting for the
          complex sample design through the use of jackknife standard
          errors. A two-class model showed that 18\&\#037; do not
          regularly consume vegetables, compared to an unweighted
          estimate of 33\&\#037;. Simulations showed that ignoring
          sample weights resulted in biased parameter estimates and
          that jackknife variances were slightly conservative but
          provided satisfactory confidence interval coverage. Using a
          survey-wide estimate of the design effect for variance
          estimation is not accurate for LCA. The methods proposed in
          this article are readily implemented for the analysis of

    {This paper proposes two new classes of estimators for regression models
    fitted to survey data. The proposed estimators account for the effect of
    nonignorable sampling schemes which are known to bias standard
    estimators. Both classes derive from relationships between the population
    distribution and the sample distribution of the sample measurements. The
    first class consists of parametric estimators. These are obtained by
    extracting the sample distribution as a function of the population
    distribution and the sample selection probabilities and applying maximum
    likelihood theory to this distribution. The second class consists of
    semi-parametric estimators, obtained by utilizing existing relationships
    between moments of the two distributions. New tests for sampling
    ignorability based on these relationships are developed. The proposed
    estimators and other estimators in common use are applied to real data
    and further compared in a simulation study. The simulations enable also
    to study the performance of the sampling ignorability tests and bootstrap
    variance estimators.},

        probabilities possibly related to the true (unknown) area means and
        the sampling of units within the selected areas is with probabilities
        possibly related to the outcome values. Ignoring the effects of the
        sampling process on the distribution of the observed outcomes in such

estimates of characteristics of interest such as means, counts, quantiles,
etc., for areas or domains for which only small samples or no samples are
available, and how to assess their precision. The purpose of this paper is to
review and discuss some of the new important developments in small area
estimation methods. Rao [Small Area Estimation (2003)] wrote a very
comprehensive book, which covers all the main developments in this topic until
that time. A few review papers have been written after 2003, but they are
limited in scope. Hence, the focus of this review is on new developments in the
last 7-8 years, but to make the review more self-contained, I also mention
shortly some of the older developments. The review covers both design-based and
model-dependent methods, with the latter methods further classified into
frequentist and Bayesian methods. The style of the paper is similar to the
style of my previous review on {SAE} published in 2002, explaining the new
problems investigated and describing the proposed solutions, but without
dwelling on theoretical details, which can be found in the original articles. I
hope that this paper will be useful both to researchers who like to learn more
on the research carried out in {SAE} and to practitioners who might be interested
in the application of the new methods.},

          an appropriate normalization of the values of the statistic
          computed over subsamples of the data. In the i.i.d.
          context, the method has been studied by Wu in regular
          situations where the statistic is asymptotically normal.
          The goal of the present work is to prove the method yields
          asymptotically valid confidence regions under minimal
          conditions. Essentially, all that is required is that the
          statistic, suitably normalized, possesses a limit
          distribution under the true model. Unlike the bootstrap,
          the convergence to the limit distribution need not be
          uniform in any sense. The method is readily adapted to
          parameters of stationary time series or, more generally,
          homogeneous random fields. For example, an immediate
          application is the construction of a confidence interval
          for the spectral density function of a homogeneous random
          field.}

        {A number of procedures have been proposed to attack different
        inference problems for data drawn from a survey with a complex sample
        design (i.e., a design that entails unequal weighting). Most
        procedures either are based on finite-population assumptions or
        require the specification of an explicit model using a
        superpopulation rationale. Herein we propose some relatively simple
        approximate procedures that are based on a superpopulation model.
        They provide valid variance estimators, test statistics, and
        confidence intervals that allow for sample design effects as
        expressed by design weights and other weights. The procedures do not
        rely on conditioning on model elements such as covariates to adjust
        for design effects. Instead, we obtain estimators by rescaling sample
        weights to sum to the equivalent sample size (equal to sample size
        divided by design effect). Using weighted estimators for
        superpopulation models, we obtain approximations to confidence bounds
        on the mean for simple sampling situations as well as for cluster
        sampling, post-stratification, and stratified sampling. We also
        obtain approximate tests of hypotheses for one-way analysis of
        variance and k ? 2 homogeneity testing. For all of these, further
        refinements based on the concept of equivalent degrees of freedom are
        provided. Additionally, a general method for determining and using
        poststratification weights is described and illustrated. The
        procedures in this article are better justified than the common
        expedient of making proportional adjustments so that the weights add
        to the sample size.},

          structural equation modeling, illustrates its use, and goes
          on to argue that it has revolutionary implications for the

          that we have, up to this point, attempted to study systems
          primarily using methods (such as the univariate model) that
          were designed only for considering individual processes.
          Understanding systems requires the capacity to examine
          simultaneous influences and responses. Structural equation
          modeling (SEM) has such capabilities. It also possesses
          many other traits that add strength to its utility as a
          means of making scientific progress. In light of the
          capabilities of SEM, it can be argued that much of
          ecological theory is currently locked in an immature state
          that impairs its relevance. It is further argued that the
          principles of SEM are capable of leading to the development
          and evaluation of multivariate theories of the sort vitally
          needed for the conservation of natural systems.

       {Generalised estimating equations enable one to estimate
       regression parameters consistently in longitudinal data
       analysis even when the correlation structure is misspecified.
       However, under such misspecification, the estimator of the
       regression parameter can be inefficient. In this paper we
       introduce a method of quadratic inference functions that does
       not involve direct estimation of the correlation parameter,
       and that remains optimal even if the working correlation
       structure is misspecified. The idea is to represent the
       inverse of the working correlation matrix by the linear
       combination of basis matrices, a representation that is valid
       for the working correlations most commonly used. Both
       asymptotic theory and simulation show that under misspecified
       working assumptions these estimators are more efficient than
       estimators from generalised estimating equations. This
       approach also provides a chi-squared inference function for
       testing nested models and a chi-squared regression
       misspecification test. Furthermore, the test statistic
       follows a chi-squared distribution asymptotically whether or
       not the working correlation structure is correctly specified.

  title     = {Assessing robustness of generalised estimating equations
          and quadratic inference functions},
  abstract  = {In the presence of data contamination or outliers, some
          empirical studies have indicated that the two methods of
          generalised estimating equations and quadratic inference
          functions appear to have rather different robustness
          behaviour.This paper presents a theoretical investigation
          from the perspective of the influence function to identify
          the causes for the difference. We show that quadratic
          inference functions lead to bounded influence functions and
          the corresponding M-estimator has a redescending property,
          but the generalised estimating equation approach does not.
          We also illustrate that, unlike generalised estimating
          equations, quadratic inference functions can still provide
          consistent estimators even if part of the data is
          contaminated. We conclude that the quadratic inference
          function is a preferable method to the generalised
          estimating equation as far as robustness is concerned. This
          conclusion is supported by simulations and real-data
          examples. 10.1093/biomet/91.2.447},

          equation modeling is introduced. The models in the

          models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear
          mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM)
          and consist of a response model and a structural model for
          the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs
          to incorporate factor structures in addition to random
          intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have
          an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced
          with different numbers of lower-level units in the
          higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of
          response processes can be modeled including ordered and
          unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of
          mixed types. The structural model is similar to the
          structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent
          and observed variables varying at different levels. For
          example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random
          coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent
          variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and
          data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for
          illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical
          Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework
          can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a
          freely available program running in Stata.}

        {Cancer surveillance research requires estimates of the prevalence of
        cancer risk factors and screening for small areas such as counties.
        Two popular data sources are the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
        System ({BRFSS}), a telephone survey conducted by state agencies, and
        the National Health Interview Survey ({NHIS}), an area probability
        sample survey conducted through face-to-face interviews. Both data
        sources have advantages and disadvantages. The {BRFSS} is a larger
        survey and almost every county is included in the survey, but it has
        lower response rates as is typical with telephone surveys and it does
        not include subjects who live in households with no telephones. On
        the other hand, the {NHIS} is a smaller survey, with the majority of
        counties not included; but it includes both telephone and
        nontelephone households, and has higher response rates. A preliminary
        analysis shows that the distributions of cancer screening and risk
        factors are different for telephone and nontelephone households.
        Thus, information from the two surveys may be combined to address
        both nonresponse and noncoverage errors. A hierarchical Bayesian
        approach that combines information from both surveys is used to
        construct county-level estimates. The proposed model incorporates
        potential noncoverage and nonresponse biases in the {BRFSS} as well
        as complex sample design features of both surveys. A Markov chain
        Monte Carlo method is used to simulate draws from the joint posterior
        distribution of unknown quantities in the model that uses
        design-based direct estimates and county-level covariates. Yearly
        prevalence estimates at the county level for 49 states, as well as
        for the entire state of Alaska and the District of Columbia, are
        developed for six outcomes using {BRFSS} and {NHIS} data from the
        years 1997?2000. The outcomes include smoking and use of common
        cancer screening procedures. The {NHIS}/{BRFSS} combined county-level
        estimates are substantially different from those based on the {BRFSS}
        alone.},

  abstract  = {Unit nonresponse and item nonresponse both occur
          frequently in surveys. Unit nonresponse is customarily
          handled by weighting adjustment, whereas item nonresponse
          is usually treated by some form of imputation. In
          particular, deterministic or stochastic imputation is often
          used to assign values for missing item responses. We
          provide an account of some recent work on jackknife
          variance estimation based on adjusted imputed values, using
          only a single imputation and hence a single completed data
          set. We also present linearized versions of the jackknife
          variance estimators. We study both stratified simple random
          sampling and stratified multistage sampling. Existing
          computer programs for jackknife and linearization variance
          estimation can be modified to implement the proposed
          variance estimators without requiring the creation and
          permanent retention of supplemental data sets. But for
          secondary analyses, the completed data set must include
          information on response status for each item as well as on
          the imputation class.}

          Methods have been developed that account for the survey
          design, but these methods require additional information
          such as survey weights, design effects or cluster
          identification for microdata. Inverse sampling (Hinkins, Oh
          and Scheuren 1997) provides an alternative approach by
          undoing the complex survey data structures so that standard
          methods can be applied. Repeated subsamples with
          unconditional simple random sampling structure are drawn
          and each subsample analysed by standard methods and then
          combined to increase the efficiency. This method has the
          potential to preserve confidentiality of microdata,
          although computer-intensive. We present some theory of
          inverse sampling and explore its limitations. A combined
          estimating equations approach is proposed for handling
          complex parameters such as ratios and ?census? linear
          regression and logistic regression parameters. The method
          is applied to a cluster correlated data set reported in

  abstract  = {SEM researchers use Monte-Carlo simulations to ascertain
          the robustness of statistical estimators and the
          performance of various fit indices under varying conditions
          of nonnormality. The efficacy of these Monte-Carlo
          simulations is closely related to the generation of
          non-normal data. Traditionally, SEM researchers have used
          approaches proposed by Fleishman (1978) and Vale and
          Maurelli (1983) to generate multivariate nonnormal random
          numbers. However, both approaches do not provide a method
          to determine univariate skewness and kurtosis of the
          observed variables when a non-normal distribution is
          specified for some or all of the latent variables. Mattson
          (1997) proposed a method for generating data on the latent
          variables with controlled skewness and kurtosis of the
          observed variables. We empirically test the applicability
          of Mattson's theoretical method in a Monte-Carlo
          simulation. Specifically, we assess the impact of data
          generation, selection of transformation method, sample size
          and degree of skewness/kurtosis on the performance of the
          method. Our results suggest that Mattson's method seems to

          Under fairly general conditions, the tests are
          asymptotically equivalent in the sense that the resulting
          critical values and power functions are appropriately
          close. This implies, among other things, that the
          difference in the critical functions of the tests,
          evaluated at the observed data, tends to 0 in probability.
          Randomization tests may be preferable since an exact
          desired level of the test may be obtained for finite
          samples. Examples considered are: testing independence,
          testing for spherical symmetry, testing for
          exchangeability, testing for homogeneity, and testing for a

          Using a Latent Dropout Class Model},
  abstract  = {In longitudinal studies with dropout, pattern-mixture
          models form an attractive modeling framework to account for
          nonignorable missing data. However, pattern-mixture models
          assume that the components of the mixture distribution are
          entirely determined by the dropout times. That is, two
          subjects with the same dropout time have the same
          distribution for their response with probability one. As
          that is unlikely to be the case, this assumption made lead
          to classification error. In addition, if there are certain
          dropout patterns with very few subjects, which often occurs
          when the number of observation times is relatively large,
          pattern-specific parameters may be weakly identified or
          require identifying restrictions. We propose an alternative
          approach, which is a latent-class model. The dropout time
          is assumed to be related to the unobserved (latent) class
          membership, where the number of classes is less than the
          number of observed patterns; a regression model for the
          response is specified conditional on the latent variable.
          This is a type of shared-parameter model, where the shared
          "parameter" is discrete. Parameter estimates are obtained
          using the method of maximum likelihood. Averaging the
          estimates of the conditional parameters over the
          distribution of the latent variable yields estimates of the
          marginal regression parameters. The methodology is
          illustrated using longitudinal data on depression from a
          study of HIV in women.},

          factor analysis and certainly should cast doubt on the

          statistics -- the likelihood ratio, Lagrange multiplier
          (efficient score), and Wald statistics -- are studied in
          the case of two types of misspecification. The first
          misspecification is that the alternative used to construct
          the test is different from the true nonnull model. In the

          of the test statistics and to examine the effects of the

          models normally requires two steps. The first step
          establishes whether (further) corrections of the model are
          necessary, and the second detects the restrictions that
          have to be corrected. The $\chi^2$ test is frequently used
          in the first step, even though this test has been severely
          criticized. The modification index introduced by Joreskog
          and Sorbom in the LISREL program is commonly used in the
          second step. In this paper, we show that both procedures
          have serious problems and that the suggestions for
          corrections are not necessarily correct. Both procedures
          are affected not only by the size of the misspecification
          in the model but also by the kind and position of the
          misspecification and by other characteristics of the model.
          Thus, some small errors in the model may be detected and
          corrected while large errors go undetected. We propose a
          new procedure to overcome this problem.}

          In this article, a design-consistent method is developed
          that borrows strength in the same way that the

          samples under the supposition that domains resemble each
          other. Under deviations from that model, however, and with
          moderate to large samples, the design-consistent method
          gives a smaller MSE. It also has the advantage that
          design-based variance estimators and design-based
          confidence intervals can be easily obtained. This article
          emphasizes that the choice of estimation method depends on
          a complex interaction of factors that include sample size,

          social, and behavioral studies to analyze linear
          interrelationships among variables, some of which may be
          unobservable or subject to measurement error. Alternative
          estimation methods that exploit different distributional
          assumptions are now available. This paper deals with issues
          of asymptotic statistical inferences, such as the
          evaluation of standard errors of estimates and chisquare
          goodness-of-fit statistics, in the general context of mean
          and covariance structures. The emphasis is on drawing
          correct statistical inferences regardless of the
          distribution of the data and the method of estimation
          employed. A simple expression for a consistent estimate
          (given any distribution of the data) of ?, the matrix of
          asymptotic variances of the vector of sample second-order
          moments, is used to compute asymptotic robust standard
          errors and an asymptotic robust chi-square goodness-of-fit
          statistic. Simple modifications of the usual estimate of ?
          also permit correct asymptotic inferences in multistage
          complex samples. We also discuss the conditions under
          which, regardless of the distribution of the data, one can
          rely on the usual (nonrobust) normal-theory inferential
          statistics. Finally, we use a multivariate regression model

          estimation are now regularly available. A variety of
          statistics, such as estimators, test statistics, and
          residuals, are computed. The sampling variability of these
          statistics is known to depend on a matrix $\Gamma$ which is
          based on the fourth-order moments of the data. Estimates of
          these fourth-order moments are expensive to compute,
          require a lot of computer storage, and have high sampling
          variability in small to moderate samples. By exploiting the
          linear relations that typically generate the covariance
          structure, we have developed conditions under which a
          matrix $\Gamma^*$, which depends only on second-order
          moments of the data, can be used as a substitute for
          $\Gamma$ to obtain correct asymptotic distributions for the
          statistics of interest. In contrast to related work on
          asymptotic robustness in covariance structure analysis, our
          theory is developed in the general setting of arbitrary
          discrepancy functions and addresses a broader class of
          statistics that include, for instance, goodness of fit
          statistics that are not necessarily asymptotically $\chi^2$
          distributed, and statistics based on the residuals.
          Basically, our theory shows that the normal theory form
          $\Gamma^*$ for $\Gamma$ can be used whenever an
          independence assumption (not only uncorrelatedness), which
          will always hold under normality, carries over to the model
          with nonnormal variables. This theory is spelled out in
          sufficient detail and simplicity so that it can be used in
          every day practice.}

  abstract  = {Normal theory maximum likelihood (ML) is by far the most
          popular estimation and testing method used in structural
          equation modeling (SEM), and it is the default in most SEM
          programs. Even though this approach assumes multivariate
          normality of the data, its use can be justified on the
          grounds that it is fairly robust to the violations of the
          distributional assumptions under some conditions. In
          support of this claim, a large literature exists outlining
          conditions under which the ML chi-square retains its
          asymptotic distribution even under nonnormality. The most
          important of these conditions is specifying a model in
          which the exogenous variables presumed to be uncorrelated
          (e.g., factors and errors in a confirmatory factor analysis
          model) are also statistically independent. The goal of this
          article is to point out that these conditions were
          developed for complete data, and in fact no longer ensure
          robustness when the data are both nonnormal and incomplete.
          This lack of robustness is illustrated both mathematically
          and empirically. Violation becomes more severe when the
          data are highly nonnormal and when a higher proportion of
          data is missing. It is concluded that if the proportion of
          missing data is greater than about 10\%, robustness of the
          ML chi-square with incomplete nonnormal data cannot be
          counted on, even if the necessary assumptions such as
          independence are made. Other approaches to model testing
          are to be preferred in this case.}

        recommended that researchers working with incomplete data sets
        routinely report this measure, as it is more informative than percent
        missing data (Bodner, 2008; Schafer, 1997). However, traditional
        estimates of $\lambda_j$ require the implementation of multiple imputation
        ({MI}). Many researchers prefer to fit structural equation models
        using full information maximum likelihood rather than {MI}. This
        article demonstrates how to obtain an estimate of $\lambda_j$ using maximum
        likelihood estimation routines only and argues that this estimate is
        superior to the estimate obtained via {MI} when the number of

        {This article builds on the work of Savalei and Bentler (2009), who
        proposed and evaluated a statistically justified two-stage ({TS})
        approach for fitting structural equation models with incomplete
        normally distributed data. The {TS} approach first obtains saturated
        maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimates of the population means and
        covariance matrix and then uses these saturated estimates in the
        complete data {ML} fitting function. Standard errors and test
        statistics are then adjusted to reflect uncertainty due to missing
        data. This work presents an extension of the {TS} methodology to
        nonnormal incomplete data (robust {TS}) and conducts an empirical
        evaluation of its performance relative to the full information
        maximum likelihood ({FIML}) approach with robust standard errors and
        a scaled chi-square statistic. The results indicate that although
        {TS} parameter estimates are slightly lower in efficiency, the {TS}
        approach performs better than {FIML} in terms of coverage and the
        rejection rate of the scaled chi-square across a wide variety of

          on the Gibbs sample are the same as those based on the
          maximum likelihood solution, for example, output from
          LISREL or EQS. In small samples, however, the likelihood

          generalize the work of Moran (1971), Chant (1974), and
          Chernoff (1954). Some of Chant's results are shown to be
          incorrect. The approach used in deriving these results
          follows from comments made by Moran and Chant. The problem
          is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the problem of
          estimating the restricted mean of a multivariate Gaussian
          distribution from a sample of size 1. In this
          representation the Gaussian random variable corresponds to
          the limit of the normalized score statistic and the
          estimate of the mean corresponds to the limit of the
          normalized maximum likelihood estimator. Thus the limiting
          distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the
          same as the distribution of the projection of the Gaussian
          random variable onto the region of admissible values for
          the mean. A variety of examples is provided for which the
          limiting distributions of likelihood ratio statistics are
          mixtures of chi-squared distributions. One example is
          provided with a nuisance parameter on the boundary for
          which the asymptotic distribution is not a mixture of
          chi-squared distributions.}

  abstract  = {Most surveys use imputation to compensate for missing
          data. However, treating the imputed data set as the
          complete data set and directly applying existing methods
          (e.g., the linearization, the jackknife, and the bootstrap)
          for variance estimation and/or statistical inference does
          not produce valid results, because these methods do not
          account for the effect of missing data and/or imputation.
          In this article we show that correct bootstrap estimates
          can be obtained by imitating the process of imputing the
          original data set in the bootstrap resampling; that is, by
          imputing the bootstrap data sets in exactly the same way
          that the original data set is imputed. The proposed
          bootstrap is asymptotically valid irrespective of the
          sampling design, the imputation method, or the type of
          statistic used in inference. This enables us to use a
          unified method in a variety of problems, and in fact this
          is the only method that works without any restriction on
          the sampling design, the imputation method, or the type of
          statistic.}

          themselves to multivariate methods of analysis. The most
          usual mode of such analysis is a standard statistical
          package, such as BMDP or SPSS, in which the multivariate
          analyses are based on the underlying assumption that the
          data are generated as independent observations from a
          common probability distribution. This assumption ignores
          the sample selection procedure involved in the survey,
          which leads to the following basic questions. What effects
          can the sample design have on methods of multivariate
          analysis? How should such effects be taken into account?
          This article considers the case of principal component
          analysis and, in particular, the point estimation of the
          eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a covariance matrix. It is
          assumed that the selection of the sample depends on the

          in stratified sampling. The conventional estimators, based
          on the assumption of simple random sampling, are compared

          likelihood estimators. Under a multivariate normal model,
          simple expressions are presented for the approximate model
          bias of the different estimators. The validity of these

  abstract  = {Most sample surveys are multivariate and many lend
          themselves to multivariate methods of analysis. The most
          usual mode of such analysis is a standard statistical
          package, such as BMDP or SPSS, in which the multivariate
          analyses are based on the underlying assumption that the
          data are generated as independent observations from a
          common probability distribution. This assumption ignores
          the sample selection procedure involved in the survey,
          which leads to the following basic questions. What effects
          can the sample design have on methods of multivariate
          analysis? How should such effects be taken into account?
          This article considers the case of principal component
          analysis and, in particular, the point estimation of the
          eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a covariance matrix. It is
          assumed that the selection of the sample depends on the
          population values of auxiliary variables as, for example,
          in stratified sampling. The conventional estimators, based
          on the assumption of simple random sampling, are compared
          with alternative probability-weighted and maximum
          likelihood estimators. Under a multivariate normal model,
          simple expressions are presented for the approximate model
          bias of the different estimators. The validity of these
          results is assessed in a simulation study involving a
          disproportionate stratified design.}

  abstract  = {The design and analysis of Monte Carlo experiments, with
          special reference to structural equation modelling, is
          discussed in this article. These topics merit
          consideration, since the validity of the conclusions drawn
          from a Monte Carlo study clearly hinges on these features.
          It is argued that comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments can
          be implemented on a PC if the experiments are adequately
          designed. This is especially important when investigating
          modern computer intensive methodologies like resampling and
          Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We are faced with three
          fundamental challenges in Monte Carlo experimentation. The
          first problem is statistical precision, which concerns the
          reliability of the obtained results. External validity, on
          the other hand, depends on the number of experimental
          conditions, and is crucial for the prospects of
          generalising the results beyond the specific experiment.
          Finally, we face the constraint on available computer
          resources. The conventional wisdom in designing and
          analysing Monte Carlo experiments embodies no explicit
          specification of meta-model for analysing the output of the
          experiment, the use of case studies or full factorial
          designs as experimental plans, no use of variance reduction
          techniques, a large number of replications, and
          "eyeballing" of the results. A critical examination of the
          conventional wisdom is presented in this article. We
          suggest that the following alternative procedures should be
          considered. First of all, we argue that it is profitable to
          specify explicit meta-models, relating the chosen
          performance statistics and experimental conditions.
          Regarding the experimental plan, we recommend the use of
          incomplete designs, which will often result in considerable
          savings. We also consider the use of common random numbers
          in the simulation phase, since this may enhance the
          precision in estimating meta-models. The use of fewer
          replications per trial, enabling us to investigate an
          increased number of experimental conditions, should also be
          considered in order to improve the external validity at the
          cost of the conventionally excessive precision.}

        a structural parameter of scientific interest. In this simple example

  abstract  = {Many asymptotic covariance estimates are generated using
          uncontaminated model distributions and thus are often based
          in part on the information matrix. Such covariance
          estimators have a low breakdown point (Donoho and Huber,
          1983; Huber, 1981; Hampel et al., 1986, p. 98; Lopuhaa and
          Rousseeuw, 1991), even if the estimate itself has a high
          breakdown point. These covariance estimates will not be
          reliable when there are outliers present. As alternative
          estimates of variability for robust estimators, we consider
          using the bootstrapped or jackknifed sample covariance
          matrix. As will be shown in this paper, the bootstrapped
          sample covariance matrix can have a breakdown point of 1/n
          regardless of the breakdown point of the estimator; thus
          both bootstrapped and asymptotic covariance estimates may
          be heavily influenced by outliers even if the original
          estimate is not. This is not the case for the jackknifed
          sample covariance matrix. If an estimate is not heavily
          influenced by outliers, its jackknifed sample covariance
          estimate is not likely to be heavily influenced by
          outliers. On the other hand, the jackknife, but not the
          bootstrap, may have a low breakdown point because the
          covariance estimate can often be shifted to zero by
          shifting a few points.},

          Binary Response Data with Informative Drop-Out},
  abstract  = {A shared parameter model with logistic link is presented
          for longitudinal binary response data to accommodate
          informative drop-out. The model consists of observed
          longitudinal and missing response components that share
          random effects parameters. To our knowledge, this is the
          first presentation of such a model for longitudinal binary
          response data. Comparisons are made to an approximate
          conditional logit model in terms of a clinical trial
          dataset and simulations. The naive mixed effects logit
          model that does not account for informative drop-out is
          also compared. The simulation-based differences among the
          models with respect to coverage of confidence intervals,
          bias, and mean squared error (MSE) depend on at least two
          factors: whether an effect is a between-or within-subject
          effect and the amount of between-subject variation as
          exhibited by variance components of the random effects
          distributions. When the shared parameter model holds, the
          approximate conditional model provides confidence intervals
          with good coverage for within-cluster factors but not for
          between-cluster factors. The converse is true for the naive
          model. Under a different drop-out mechanism, when the
          probability of drop-out is dependent only on the current
          unobserved observation, all three models behave similarly
          by providing between-subject confidence intervals with good
          coverage and comparable MSE and bias but poor
          within-subject confidence intervals, MSE, and bias. The
          naive model does more poorly with respect to the
          within-subject effects than do the shared parameter and
          approximate conditional models. The data analysis, which
          entails a comparison of two pain relievers and a placebo
          with respect to pain relief, conforms to the simulation
          results based on the shared parameter model but not on the
          simulation based on the outcome-driven drop-out process.
          This comparison between the data analysis and simulation
          results may provide evidence that the shared parameter
          model holds for the pain data.},

        partner items were embedded. The three mode groups did not differ in

        of reporting of sensitive behaviors: both forms of
        self-administration tended to reduce the disparity between men and

        fewer sex partners were reported than when the options emphasized the

          sample surveys to improve efficiency of estimators. Survey
          weights are adjusted to force the estimated numbers of
          units in each of a set of estimation cells to be equal to
          known population totals. The resulting weights are then
          used in forming estimates of means or totals of variables
          collected in the survey. For example, in a household survey
          the estimation cells may be based on age/race/sex
          categories of individuals, and the known totals may come
          from the most recent population census. Although the
          variance of a poststratified estimator can be computed over
          all possible sample configurations, inferences made
          conditionally on the achieved sample configuration are
          desirable. Theory and a simulation study using data from
          the U.S. Current Population Survey are presented to study
          both the conditional bias and variance of the
          poststratified estimator of a total. The linearization,
          balanced repeated replication, and jackknife variance
          estimators are also examined to determine whether they
          appropriately estimate the conditional variance.}

          appended to the analysis file for each jackknife replicate.
          If the replicate weight adjustments and the grouped
          jackknife itself are not appropriately constructed, the
          variance estimates can have some extremely pathological
          behavior when estimating totals. When the dropout groups do

          the standard version of the grouped jackknife may be a
          severe overestimate. This problem is most likely to arise
          in single-stage samples with a large number of first-stage
          units in many of the strata. The standard grouped jackknife

          proposed a selection model for continuous longitudinal data
          subject to nonrandom dropout. It has provoked a large
          debate about the role for such models. The original
          enthusiasm was followed by skepticism about the strong but
          untestable assumptions on which this type of model
          invariably rests. Since then, the view has emerged that
          these models should ideally be made part of a sensitivity
          analysis. This paper presents a formal and flexible
          approach to such a sensitivity assessment based on local
          influence (Cook, 1986, Journal of the Royal Statistical
          Society, Series B 48, 133-169). The influence of perturbing
          a missing-at-random dropout model in the direction of
          nonrandom dropout is explored. The method is applied to

  abstract  = {An extension of latent class (LC) and finite mixture
          models is described for the analysis of hierarchical data
          sets. As is typical in multilevel analysis, the dependence
          between lower-level units within higher-level units is
          dealt with by assuming that certain model parameters differ
          randomly across higher-level observations. One of the
          special cases is an LC model in which group-level
          differences in the logit of belonging to a particular LC
          are captured with continuous random effects. Other variants
          are obtained by including random effects in the model for
          the response variables rather than for the LCs. The variant
          that receives most attention in this article is an LC model
          with discrete random effects: higher-level units are
          clustered based on the likelihood of their members
          belonging to the various LCs. This yields a model with
          mixture distributions at two levels, namely at the group
          and the subject level. This model is illustrated with three
          rather different empirical examples. The appendix describes
          an adapted version of the expectation--maximization
          algorithm that can be used for maximum likelihood
          estimation, as well as providing setups for estimating the
          multilevel LC model with generally available software.

          of statistical techniques used for the analysis of
          multivariate data to measure latent variables and their

          research in medical education. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
          article is to introduce SEM to medical education
          researchers and provide procedural information for applying
          SEM. METHODS: We outline the basic tenets of SEM,
          principles of model creation, identification, estimation,
          and model fit to data, and the use of SEM in medical
          education research. RESULTS: Although it is a powerful
          statistical research tool, SEM has had only limited use in
          medical education research. We explicate a five-step
          procedure for applying SEM to research problems and
          summarize an example of SEM to test a hypothetical model.
          CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding some pitfalls, SEM does
          provide promise for testing complex, integrated theoretical
          models and advance research in medical education.},

          derive the asymptotic distributions of LR and LM type
          statistics for testing simple hypotheses on structural
          parameters based on maximum likelihood and generalized
          method of moments estimation methods. In contrast to the
          nonstandard limiting behavior of Wald statistics, the
          limiting distributions of certain LM and LR statistics are
          bounded by a chi-square distribution with degrees of
          freedom given by the number of instruments. Further, we
          show how to construct asymptotically valid confidence sets
          for structural parameters by inverting these statistics.}

        {Kish's (1962) classical intra-interviewer correlation (roh int)
        provides survey researchers with an estimate of the effect of
        interviewers on variation in measurements of a survey variable of
        interest. This correlation is an undesirable product of the data
        collection process that can arise when answers from respondents
        interviewed by the same interviewer are more similar to each other
        than answers from other respondents, decreasing the precision of
        survey estimates. Estimation of this parameter, however, uses only
        respondent data. The potential contribution of variance in
        nonresponse errors between interviewers to the estimation of roh int has
        been largely ignored. Responses within interviewers may appear
        correlated because the interviewers successfully obtain cooperation
        from different pools of respondents, not because of systematic
        response deviations. This study takes a first step in filling this
        gap in the literature on interviewer effects by analyzing a unique
        survey data set, collected using computer-assisted telephone
        interviewing (CATI) from a sample of divorce records. This data set,
        which includes both true values and reported values for respondents
        and a CATI sample assignment that approximates interpenetrated
        assignment of subsamples to interviewers, enables the decomposition
        of interviewer variance in means of respondent reports into
        nonresponse error variance and measurement error variance across
        interviewers. We show that in cases where there is substantial
        interviewer variance in reported values, the interviewer variance may
        arise from nonresponse error variance across interviewers.},

  abstract  = {Monte Carlo studies have shown that estimated asymptotic
          standard errors of the efficient two-step generalized
          method of moments (GMM) estimator can be severely downward
          biased in small samples. The weight matrix used in the
          calculation of the efficient two-step GMM estimator is
          based on initial consistent parameter estimates. In this
          paper it is shown that the extra variation due to the
          presence of these estimated parameters in the weight matrix
          accounts for much of the difference between the finite
          sample and the usual asymptotic variance of the two-step
          GMM estimator, when the moment conditions used are linear
          in the parameters. This difference can be estimated,
          resulting in a finite sample corrected estimate of the
          variance. In a Monte Carlo study of a panel data model it
          is shown that the corrected variance estimate approximates
          the finite sample variance well, leading to more accurate

  abstract  = {Most major population surveys used by social scientists
          are based on complex sampling designs where sampling units
          have different probabilities of being selected. Although
          sampling weights must generally be used to derive unbiased
          estimates of univariate population characteristics, the
          decision about their use in regression analysis is more
          complicated. Where sampling weights are solely a function
          of independent variables included in the model, unweighted
          OLS estimates are preferred because they are unbiased,
          consistent, and have smaller standard errors than weighted
          OLS estimates. Where sampling weights are a function of the
          dependent variable (and thus of the error term), we
          recommend first attempting to respecify the model so that
          they are solely a function of the independent variables. If
          this can be accomplished, then unweighted OLS is again
          preferred. If the model cannot be respecified, then
          estimation of the model using sampling weights may be
          appropriate. In this case, however, the formula used by
          most computer programs for calculating standard errors will
          be incorrect. We recommend using the White heteroskedastic
          consistent estimator for the standard errors.

          distribution has appeared to play a special role. In this
          article we consider what happens when the normal "base"
          distribution is replaced by an arbitrary base distribution.
          Generalized versions of several standard formulas, are
          presented. The choice of a chi-squared base or an inverse
          Gaussian base is then considered in detail. The generalized
          approximations are compared in two examples: a linear
          combination of chi-squared variables and the first passage
          time distribution for a random walk. The former example
          considers approximations using the chi-squared base that
          are slightly more accurate than their normal-based
          counterparts. In the latter example, approximations based
          on the inverse Gaussian are considerably more accurate than
          their normal-based counterparts.},

        {We present a surprising though obvious result that seems to have
        been unnoticed until now. In particular, we demonstrate the
        equivalence of two well-known problems?the optimal allocation of the
        fixed overall sample size n among L strata under stratified random
        sampling and the optimal allocation of the H = 435 seats among the 50
        states for apportionment of the {U.S}. House of Representatives
        following each decennial census. In spite of the strong similarity
        manifest in the statements of the two problems, they have not been
        linked and they have well-known but different solutions; one solution
        is not explicitly exact (Neyman allocation), and the other (equal
        proportions) is exact. We give explicit exact solutions for both and
        note that the solutions are equivalent. In fact, we conclude by
        showing that both problems are special cases of a general problem.
        The result is significant for stratified random sampling in that it
        explicitly shows how to minimize sampling error when estimating a
        total {TY} while keeping the final overall sample size fixed at n;
        this is usually not the case in practice with Neyman allocation where
        the resulting final overall sample size might be near n + L after
        rounding. An example reveals that controlled rounding with Neyman
        allocation does not always lead to the optimum allocation, that is,
        an allocation that minimizes variance.},

       how to effectively use the complete auxiliary information at

  title     = {On Measuring and Correcting the Effects of Data Mining and

  abstract  = {In the theory of linear models, the concept of degrees of
          freedom plays an important role. This concept is often used
          for measurement of model complexity, for obtaining an
          unbiased estimate of the error variance, and for comparison
          of different models. I have developed a concept of
          generalized degrees of freedom (GDF) that is applicable to
          complex modeling procedures. The definition is based on the
          sum of the sensitivity of each fitted value to perturbation
          in the corresponding observed value. The concept is
          nonasymptotic in nature and does not require analytic
          knowledge of the modeling procedures. The concept of GDF
          offers a unified framework under which complex and highly
          irregular modeling procedures can be analyzed in the same
          way as classical linear models. By using this framework,
          many difficult problems can be solved easily. For example,
          one can now measure the number of observations used in a
          variable selection process. Different modeling procedures,
          such as a tree-based regression and a projection pursuit
          regression, can be compared on the basis of their residual
          sums of squares and the GDF that they cost. I apply the
          proposed framework to measure the effect of variable
          selection in linear models, leading to corrections of
          selection bias in various goodness-of-fit statistics. The
          theory also has interesting implications for the effect of
          general model searching by a human modeler.},

          where the sampling error variances are estimated
          individually by direct estimators. A full hierarchical
          Bayes (HB) model is constructed for the direct survey
          estimators and the sampling error variances estimators. The
          Gibbs sampling method is employed to obtain the small area

          account of the extra uncertainty of estimating the sampling
          error variances, especially when the areaspecific sample
          sizes are small. We compare the proposed HB model with the
          Fay?Herriot model through analysis of two survey data sets.
          Our results have shown that the proposed HB estimators
          perform quite well compared to the direct estimates. We
          also discussed the problem of priors on the variance

          Under a sequence of local alternative hypotheses, this

          However, in any statistical modeling, the distribution
          specification for the likelihood function is at best only
          an approximation to the real world. In particular, since
          the normal-distribution-based ML is typically applied to
          data with heterogeneous marginal skewness and kurtosis, it
          is necessary to know whether such a practice still

          components and missing data are MAR, this paper shows that
          the normal-distribution-based MLE is consistent regardless

          the consistency of the MLE is not guaranteed for all

          follows a confirmatory factor model, and data are missing
          due to the magnitude of the factors, the MLE may not be
          consistent even when data are normally distributed. When

          shows that, under certain data models and MAR mechanism,
          the MLE is asymptotically normally distributed and the
          asymptotic covariance matrix is consistently estimated by
          the commonly used sandwich-type covariance matrix. The

       fitting the ordinary sample covariance matrix by a proposed

       influenced by a few outlying cases, the standard practice of
       modeling sample covariances can lead to inefficient estimates
       as well as inflated fit indices. By giving a proper weight to
       each individual case, a robust covariance will have a bounded
       influence function as well as a nonzero breakdown point.
       These robust properties of the covariance estimators will be
       carried over to the parameter estimators in the structural
       model if a technically appropriate procedure is used. We
       study such a procedure in which robust covariances replace
       ordinary sample covariances in the context of the Wishart
       likelihood function. This procedure is easy to implement in
       practice. Statistical properties of this procedure are
       investigated. A fit index is given based on sampling from an
       elliptical distribution. An estimating equation approach is
       used to develop a variety of robust covariances, and
       consistent covariances of these robust estimators, needed for
       standard errors and test statistics, follow from this

          theory based methods for nonnormal data very often lead to
          incorrect model evaluations. By dropping the normal
          distribution assumption, we develop more accurate
          procedures for model inference. Based on the theory of
          generalized estimating equations, a way to obtain
          consistent standard errors of the two-stage estimates is
          given. The asymptotic efficiencies of different estimators
          are compared under various assumptions. We also propose a
          minimum chi-square approach and show that the estimator
          obtained by this approach is asymptotically at least as
          efficient as the two likelihood-based estimators for either
          normal or nonnormal data. The major contribution of this
          paper is that for each estimator, we give a test statistic
          whose asymptotic distribution is chi-square as long as the
          underlying sampling distribution enjoys finite fourth-order
          moments. We also give a characterization for each of the
          two likelihood ratio test statistics when the underlying
          distribution is nonnormal. Modifications to the likelihood
          ratio statistics are also given. Our working assumption is
          that the missing data mechanism is missing completely at
          random. Examples and Monte Carlo studies indicate that, for
          commonly encountered nonnormal distributions, the
          procedures developed in this paper are quite reliable even
          for samples with missing data that are missing at random.}

          difference test is often applied to evaluate the number of
          factors, cross-group constraints, and other nested model
          comparisons. Let model Ma be the base model within which
          model Mb is nested. In practice, this test is commonly used
          to justify Mb even when Ma is misspecified. The authors
          study the behavior of the chi-square difference test in
          such a circumstance. Monte Carlo results indicate that a
          nonsignificant chi-square difference cannot be used to
          justify the constraints in Mb. They also show that when the

          that the intercept and slope parameters in growth curve
          models can be estimated consistently even when the
          covariance structure is misspecified, but only in linear
          growth models. Similarly, with misspecified covariance
          structures, the mean parameters in multiple group models
          can be estimated consistently under null conditions.

          Classical methods for structural equation modeling fit a

          structural model to a robust covariance matrix for data

  abstract  = {Various fit indices exist in structural equation models.
          Most of these indices are related to the noncentrality
          parameter (NCP) of the chi-square distribution that the
          involved test statistic is implicitly assumed to follow.
          Existing literature suggests that few statistics can be
          well approximated by chi-square distributions. The meaning
          of the NCP is not clear when the behavior of the statistic
          cannot be described by a chi-square distribution. In this
          paper we define a new measure of model misfit (MMM) as the
          difference between the expected values of a statistic under
          the alternative and null hypotheses. This definition does
          not need to assume that the population covariance matrix is
          in the vicinity of the proposed model, nor does it need for
          the test statistic to follow any distribution of a known
          form. The MMM does not necessarily equal the discrepancy
          between the model and the population covariance matrix as
          has been assumed in existing literature. Bootstrap
          approaches to estimating the MMM and a related quantity are
          developed. An algorithm for obtaining bootstrap confidence
          intervals of the MMM is constructed. Examples with
          practical data sets contrast several measures of model
          misfit. The quantile-quantile plot is used to illustrate
          the unrealistic nature of chi-square distribution

          application of structural equation models, every
          interesting model is fallible. When simultaneously
          evaluating a model, it is of interest to study whether all
          parameters are affected by a misspecification. This paper
          provides three procedures for evaluating such an effect:
          (1) analyzing the path, (2) using a functional
          relationship, and (3) using a significance test. Analyzing
          the path is illustrated through a confirmatory factor
          model. This method is ad hoc but intuitive. A more rigorous
          approach is built upon the concept of orthogonality of two
          sets of parameters. When parameter a is orthogonal to
          parameter b, omitting parameter b will not affect the
          estimation of parameter a. The functional relationship of
          two sets of parameters is used to check their
          orthogonality. The distribution of the difference between
          estimates based on different models is obtained, which
          provides a Hausman-like way to check significant parameter
          differences that are due to biases. Examples illustrate
          that these procedures can provide valuable information on
          identifying parameter estimates that are systematically

       to obtain consistent {SEs} for one of the robust methods is
       also developed. The formula-based {SEs} for both robust
       estimators match the empirical {SEs} very well with
       medium-size samples. A sample of the Cross Racial Identity
       Scale with a 6-factor model is used for illustration. Results
       also confirm conclusions of the simulation study.},

  title     = {Applying the bootstrap to the multivariate case: Bootstrap
          component/factor analysis},
  abstract  = {The bootstrap method, which empirically estimates the
          sampling distribution for either inferential or descriptive
          statistical purposes, can be applied to the multivariate
          case. When conducting bootstrap component, or factor,
          analysis, resampling results must be located in a common
          factor space before summary statistics for each estimated
          parameter can be computed. The present article describes a
          strategy for applying the bootstrap method to conduct
          either a bootstrap component or a factor analysis with a
          program syntax for SPSS. The Holzinger-Swineford data set
          is employed to make the discussion more concrete.},

          Dynamics show that nonrandom attrition is of little concern

          effect of attrition is absorbed into fixed effects in labor
          supply. The wage measure and instrument set have much
          larger effects on the estimated labor supply function of
          prime-age men than how one adjusts for panel attrition.},

          regression with multiple endogenous right-hand-side
          variables and weak instruments is analyzed. The previous
          work of Choi and Phillips (1992) is extended to allow for
          weak instruments. The existing techniques for performing
          inference on individual coefficients using Staiger and
          Stock's (1997) weak instruments asymptotics is evaluated.
          The finite sample properties are analyzed using Monte Carlo
          simulations. The only asymptotically valid tests for
          individual coefficients are shown to be based on
          projections of asymptotically valid tests for all
          coefficients. Kleibergen's (2002) concentrated K statistic
